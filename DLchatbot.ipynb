In a mere five years,  we’ve gone from near-unusable image recognition and\\nspeech transcription, to superhuman performance on these tasks.\\n The consequences of this sudden progre ss extend to almost every industry. But in\\norder to begin deploying deep-learning technology to every problem that it could\\nsolve, we need to make it accessible to as many people as possible, including non-\\nexperts—people who aren’t re searchers or graduate stud ents. For deep learning to\\nreach its full potential, we need to radically democratize it.\\n When I released the first version of th e Keras deep-learning framework in March\\n2015, the democratization of AI wasn’t what I had in mind . I had been doing research\\nin machine learning for several years, and had built Keras to help me with my own\\nexperiments. But throughout 2015 and 2016, tens of thousands of new people\\nentered the field of deep learning; many of  them picked up Keras because it was—and\\nstill is—the easiest framework to get starte d with. As I watched scores of newcomers\\nuse Keras in unexpected, powerful ways, I ca me to care deeply about the accessibility\\nand democratization of AI. I realized that the further we spread these technologies,\\nthe more useful and valuable they become . Accessibility quickly became an explicit\\ngoal in the development of Keras, and over a few short years, the Keras developer\\ncommunity has made fantastic achievements on this front. We’ve put deep learning\\ninto the hands of tens of thousands of people , who in turn are using it to solve import-\\nant problems we didn’t even know existed until recently.\\n The book you’re holding is another step on  the way to making deep learning avail-\\nable to as many people as  possible.

Whether you’re a practicing machine-learn-\\ning engineer, a software developer, or a colle ge student, you’ll find value in these pages.\\n This book offers a practical, hands-on expl oration of deep learning. It avoids math-\\nematical notation, preferring instead to ex plain quantitative concepts via code snip-\\npets and to build practical intuition about the core ideas of machine learning and\\ndeep learning. \\n You’ll learn from more than 30 code examples that include detailed commentary,\\npractical recommendations, and simple high -level explanations of everything you\\nneed to know to start using deep learning to solve concrete problems.\\n The code examples use the Python deep-learning framework Keras, with Tensor-\\nFlow as a backend engine. Keras, one of the most popular and fastest-growing deep-\\nlearning frameworks, is widely recommended as the best tool to get started with deep\\nlearning. \\n After reading this book, you’ll have a soli d understand of what deep learning is,\\nwhen it’s applicable, and what its limitations  are. You’ll be familiar with the standard\\nworkflow for approaching and solving machine-learning problems, and you’ll know\\nhow to address commonly enco untered issues.

Additionally, famil-\\niarity with the Numpy library will be helpful, although it isn’t required. You don’t need\\nprevious experience with machine learning  or deep learning: this book covers from\\nscratch all the necessary basics. You don’t need an advanced mathematics background,\\neither—high school–level mathematics shou ld suffice in order to follow along.\\nRoadmap\\nThis book is structured in two parts. If you have no prior experience with machine\\nlearning, I strongly recommend that you co mplete part 1 before approaching part 2.\\nWe’ll start with simple examples, and as th e book goes on, we’ll get increasingly close\\nto state-of-the-art techniques.\\n Part 1 is a high-level introduction to deep learning, providing context and defini-\\ntions, and explaining all the notions requ ired to get started with machine learning\\nand neural networks:\\n\\uf0a1Chapter 1 presents essential contex t and background knowledge around AI,\\nmachine learning, and deep learning.\\n\\uf0a1Chapter 2 introduces fundamental conc epts necessary in order to approach\\ndeep learning: tensors, te nsor operations, gradient descent, and backpropaga-\\ntion.

You’ll need access to a UNIX\\nmachine; it’s possible to us e Windows, too, but I don’t recommend it. Appendix A\\nwalks you through the complete setup. \\n I also recommend that you have a recent NVIDIA  GPU on your machine, such as a\\nTITAN  X. This isn’t required, but it will make your experience better by allowing you\\nto run the code examples several times faster. See section 3.3 for more informationabout setting up a deep -learning workstation.\\n If you don’t have access to a local workstation with a recent \\nNVIDIA  GPU, you can\\nuse a cloud environment, instead. In particular, you can use Google Cloud instances\\n(such as an n1-standar d-8 instance with an NVIDIA  Tesla K80 add-on) or Amazon Web\\nServices ( AWS) GPU instances (such as a p2.xlarge in stance).

What\\nare artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning (see figure 1.1)? How\\ndo they relate to each other?\\n1.1.1 Artificial intelligence\\nArtificial intelligence was born in the 195 0s, when a handful of pioneers from the\\nnascent field of computer science started asking whether computers could be made to\\n“think”—a question whose ramifications we’r e still exploring today. A concise defini-\\ntion of the field would be as follows: the effort to automate inte llectual tasks normally per-\\nformed by humans . As such, AI is a general field that encompasses machine learning and\\ndeep learning, but that also includes many  more approaches that don’t involve any\\nlearning. Early chess programs,  for instance, only involved hardcoded rules crafted by\\nprogrammers, and didn’t qualify as machin e learning. For a fairly long time, many\\nexperts believed that human-le vel artificial intelligence could be achieved by having\\nprogrammers handcraft a suffi ciently large set of explicit rules for manipulating\\nknowledge. This approach is known as symbolic AI, and it was the dominant paradigm\\nin AI from the 1950s to the late 1980s. It reached its peak popularity during the expert\\nsystems  boom of the 1980s.\\n Although symbolic AI proved suitable to solve well-d efined, logical problems, such as\\nplaying chess, it turned out to be intractabl e to figure out explicit rules for solving more\\ncomplex, fuzzy problems, such as image cla ssification, speech recognition, and lan-\\nguage translation. A new approa ch arose to take symbolic AI’s place: machine learning .\\n1.1.2 Machine learning\\nIn Victorian England, Lady Ada Lovelace was a friend and coll aborator of Charles\\nBabbage, the inventor of the Analytical Engine : the first-known general-purpose,\\nmechanical computer. Although visionary and far ahead of its time, the AnalyticalArtificial\\nintelligence\\nMachine\\nlearning\\nDeep\\nlearning\\nFigure 1.1 Artificial intelligence, \\nmachine learning, and deep learning\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 26}),\n",

It was merely meant as a way to use mechanical operatio ns to automate cer-\\ntain computations from the field of math ematical analysis—hence, the name Analyti-\\ncal Engine. In 1843, Ada Lovelace remarked on the invention, “The Analytical Engine\\nhas no pretensions whatever to originate an ything. It can do whatever we know how to\\norder it to perform.… Its prov ince is to assist us in making available what we’re\\nalready acquainted with.”\\n This remark was later quoted by AI pioneer Alan Turing as “Lady Lovelace’s objec-\\ntion” in his landmark 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,”1 which\\nintroduced the Turing test  as well as key concepts that would come to shape AI. Turing\\nwas quoting Ada Lovelace while pondering whether general-purpose computers could\\nbe capable of learning and originality, and he came to the conclusion that they could.\\n Machine learning arises from this ques tion: could a computer go beyond “what we\\nknow how to order it to perform” and learn on its own how to perf orm a specified task?\\nCould a computer surprise us? Rather th an programmers crafting data-processing\\nrules by hand, could a computer automatica lly learn these rules by looking at data?\\n This question opens the door to a ne w programming paradigm. In classical pro-\\ngramming, the paradigm of symbolic AI, hu mans input rules (a program) and data to\\nbe processed according to th ese rules, and out come answ ers (see figure 1.2). With\\nmachine learning, humans input data as well  as the answers expected from the data,\\nand out come the rules. These rules can then  be applied to new data to produce orig-\\ninal answers.\\nA machine-learning system is trained  rather than explicitly programmed. It’s presented\\nwith many examples relevant to a task, and it finds statistical structure in these exam-\\nples that eventually allows the system to come up with rules for automating the task.\\nFor instance, if you wished to automate the task of tagging your vacation pictures, you\\ncould present a machine-learning system wi th many examples of pictures already\\ntagged by humans, and the system would lear n statistical rules fo r associating specific\\npictures to specific tags.\\n1A.

              " Document(page_content='6 CHAPTER  1What is deep learning?\\n Although machine learning only started to  flourish in the 1990s, it has quickly\\nbecome the most popular and mo st successful subfield of AI, a trend driven by the\\navailability of faster hardware and larger datasets. Machine learning is tightly related\\nto mathematical statistics, but it differs from statistics in several important ways.\\nUnlike statistics, machine learning tends to deal with large, complex datasets (such as\\na dataset of millions of images, each consis ting of tens of thousands of pixels) for\\nwhich classical statistical analys is such as Bayesian analysis  would be impractical. As a\\nresult, machine learning, and especially de ep learning, exhibits  comparatively little\\nmathematical theory—maybe too little—and is engineering oriented. It’s a hands-on\\ndiscipline in which ideas are proven empirically more often than theoretically.\\n1.1.3 Learning representations from data\\nTo define deep learning  and understand the difference between deep learning\\nand other machine-learning ap proaches, first we need some idea of what machine-\\nlearning algorithms do. I just stated that machine lear ning discovers rules to execute\\na data-processing task, given examples of what’s expected. So, to do machine learn-\\ning, we need three things:\\n\\uf0a1Input data points —For instance, if the task is speech recognition, these data\\npoints could be sound files of people speaking. If the task  is image tagging,\\nthey could be pictures.\\n\\uf0a1Examples of the expected output —In a speech-recognition task, these could be\\nhuman-generated transcripts of sound files. In an im age task, expected outputs\\ncould be tags such as “dog,” “cat,” and so on.\\n\\uf0a1A way to measure whether the algorithm is doing a good job —This is necessary in\\norder to determine the distance between the algorithm’s current output andits expected output. The measurement is used as a feedback signal to adjust\\nthe way the algorithm works. This adjustment step is what we call learning .\\nA machine-learning model tran sforms its input data into meaningful outputs, a pro-\\ncess that is “learned” from exposure to kn own examples of inputs and outputs. There-\\nfore, the central problem in machine learning and deep learning is to meaningfully\\ntransform data : in other words, to learn useful representations  of the input data at\\nhand—representations that get us closer to  the expected output. Before we go any\\nfurther: what’s a representation? At its core, it’s a different way to look at data—to rep-\\nresent  or encode  data. For instance, a color image can be encoded in the \\nRGB format\\n(red-green-blue) or in the HSV format (hue-saturation-value): these are two different\\nrepresentations of the same data. Some task s that may be difficult with one represen-\\ntation can become easy with another. For exam ple, the task “select all red pixels in the\\nimage” is simpler in the RG format, whereas “make the image less saturated” is simpler\\nin the HSV format. Machine-learning models ar e all about finding appropriate repre-\\nsentations for their input data—transformatio ns of the data that make it more amena-\\nble to the task at hand, such as a classification task.\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 28}),\n",

Cons ider an x-axis, a y-axis, and\\nsome points represented by their coordinates in the (x, y) sys-\\ntem, as shown in figure 1.3.\\n As you can see, we have a few white points and a few black\\npoints. Let’s say we want to develop an algorithm that can take\\nthe coordinates (x, y) of a point and output whether that\\npoint is likely to be black or to be white. In this case,\\n\\uf0a1The inputs are the coordinates of our points.\\n\\uf0a1The expected outputs are the colors of our points.\\n\\uf0a1A way to measure whether our algorithm is doing agood job could be, for instance, the percentage of\\npoints that are being correctly classified.\\nWhat we need here is a new representation of our data that cleanly separates the white\\npoints from the black points. One transfor mation we could use, among many other\\npossibilities, would be a coordinate change, illustrated in figure 1.4.\\nIn this new coordinate system, the coordinate s of our points can be said to be a new\\nrepresentation of our data. And it’s a go od one! With this representation, the\\nblack/white classification problem can be expressed as a simple rule: “Black points\\nare such that x > 0,” or “White points are such that x < 0.” This new representation\\nbasically solves the classification problem.\\n In this case, we defined the coordinate change by hand. But if instead we tried sys-\\ntematically searching for different possible coordinate changes, and used as feedback\\nthe percentage of points being correctly cl assified, then we would be doing machine\\nlearning. Learning , in the context of machine learni ng, describes an automatic search\\nprocess for better representations.\\n All machine-learning algorithms consist of  automatically finding such transforma-\\ntions that turn data into more-useful re presentations for a given task. These opera-\\ntions can be coordinate changes, as you ju st saw, or linear pr ojections (which may\\ndestroy information), translations, nonlinea r operations (such as “select all points\\nsuch that x > 0”), and so on.

This simple idea allows for solv ing a remarkably broad range\\nof intellectual tasks, from speech re cognition to autonomous car driving.\\n Now that you understand what we mean by learning , let’s take a look at what makes\\ndeep learning  special. \\n1.1.4 The “deep” in deep learning\\nDeep learning is a specific subfield of ma chine learning: a new take on learning repre-\\nsentations from data that puts an  emphasis on learning successive layers  of increasingly\\nmeaningful representations. The deep in deep learning  isn’t a reference to any kind of\\ndeeper understanding achieved by the approach ; rather, it stands for this idea of suc-\\ncessive layers of representations. How many layers contribute to a model of the data is\\ncalled the depth  of the model. Other appropriate names for the field could have been\\nlayered representations learning  and hierarchical representations learning . Modern deep\\nlearning often involves tens or even hundre ds of successive layers of representations—\\nand they’re all learned automatically from  exposure to training data. Meanwhile,\\nother approaches to machine learning tend to focus on learning only one or two lay-\\ners of representations of the data ; hence, they’re sometimes called shallow learning .\\n In deep learning, these layered representations are (almost always) learned via\\nmodels called neural networks , structured in literal layers stacked on top of each other.\\nThe term neural network  is a reference to neurobiology , but although some of the cen-\\ntral concepts in deep learni ng were developed in part by drawing inspiration from our\\nunderstanding of the brain, deep-learning models are not m o d e l s  o f  t h e  b r a i n .\\nThere’s no evidence that the brain implem ents anything like the learning mecha-\\nnisms used in modern deep-learning mode ls. You may come across pop-science arti-\\ncles proclaiming that deep learning work s like the brain or was modeled after the\\nbrain, but that isn’t the case. It would be confusing and counterproductive for new-\\ncomers to the field to think of deep learni ng as being in any way related to neurobiol-\\nogy; you don’t need that shroud of “just li ke our minds” mystique and mystery, and\\nyou may as well forget anyt hing you may have read abou t hypothetical links between\\ndeep learning and biology.

Now let’s look at how this\\nlearning happens, concretely.\\n The specification of what a layer does to  its input data is stored in the layer’s\\nweights , which in essence are a bunc h of numbers. In technical terms, we’d say that the\\ntransformation implemented by a layer is parameterized  by its weights (see figure 1.7).\\n(Weights are also sometimes called the parameters  of a layer.) In this context, learning\\nmeans finding a set of values for the weights of all layers in a network, such that the\\nnetwork will correctly map example inputs to  their associated targets. But here’s the\\nthing: a deep neural networ k can contain tens of millions of parameters. Finding the\\ncorrect value for all of them may seem like a daunting task, especially given that mod-\\nifying the value of one pa rameter will affect the behavior of all the others!\\nTo control something, first you need to be able to observe it. To control the output of\\na neural network, you need to be able to measure how far this output is from what you\\nexpected. This is the job of the loss function  of the network, also called the objective\\nfunction . The loss function takes the prediction s of the network and the true target\\n(what you wanted the network to output) and computes a distance score, capturinghow well the network has done on this  specific example (see figure 1.8).Goal: finding the\\nright values for\\nthese weightsLayer\\n(data transformation)Input X\\nWeights\\nLayer\\n(data transformation)\\nPredictions\\nY'Weights\\nFigure 1.7 A neural network is \\nparameterized by its weights.\\nLayer\\n(data transformation)Input X\\nWeights\\nLayer\\n(data transformation)\\nPredictions\\nY'True targets\\nYWeights\\nLoss function\\nLoss scoreFigure 1.8 A loss function measures \\nthe quality of the network’s output.\\nLicensed to   <null>\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n",

This adjustment is the job of the optimizer , which\\nimplements what’s called the Backpropagation  algorithm: the central algorithm in deep\\nlearning. The next chapter explains in more detail how backpropagation works.\\nInitially, the weights of the network are assigned random values, so the network\\nmerely implements a series of random tran sformations. Naturally, its output is far\\nfrom what it should ideally be, and the lo ss score is accordingly very high. But with\\nevery example the network processes, the weig hts are adjusted a little in the correct\\ndirection, and the loss scor e decreases. This is the training loop , which, repeated a suffi-\\ncient number of times (typically tens of it erations over thousands of examples), yields\\nweight values that minimize the loss functi on.

The risk\\nwith high expectations for the short term is that, as technology fails to deliver,research investment will dry up, slowing progress for a long time.\\n This has happened before. Twice in the pa st, AI went through a cycle of intense\\noptimism followed by disappointment and skepticism, wi th a dearth of funding as a\\nresult. It started with symbolic \\nAI in the 1960s. In those early days, projections about AI\\nwere flying high. One of the best-known pi oneers and proponents of the symbolic AI\\napproach was Marvin Minsky, who claimed in  1967, “Within a generation … the prob-\\nlem of creating ‘artificial intelligence’ will substantially be solved.” Three years later, in\\n1970, he made a more precisely quantified prediction: “In from three to eight years wewill have a machine with the general intelli gence of an average human being.” In 2016,\\nsuch an achievement still appears to be far in the future—so far that we have no way to\\npredict how long it will take—but in the 1 960s and early 1970s, se veral experts believed\\nit to be right around the corner (as do many  people today). A few years later, as these\\nhigh expectations failed to materialize,  researchers and gove rnment funds turned\\naway from the field, marking the start of the first \\nAI winter  (a reference to a nuclear win-\\nter, because this was shortly after the height of the Cold War).\\n It wouldn’t be the last one. In the 1980s, a new take on symbolic AI, expert systems ,\\nstarted gathering steam among large companie s. A few initial succ ess stories triggered\\na wave of investment, with corporations around the worl d starting their own in-house\\nAI departments to develop ex pert systems. Around 1985,  companies were spending\\nover $1 billion each year on the technolo gy; but by the early 1990s, these systems had\\nproven expensive to maintain, difficult to scale, and limited in scope, and interest\\ndied down.

Your doctor doesn’t yet use \\nAI, and neither does your accountant. You\\nprobably don’t use AI technologies in your day-to-day  life.

That’s a far cry from wh ere such technologies used to stand. But\\nsuch tools are still only acce ssories to our daily lives. AI has yet to transition to being\\ncentral to the way we work, think, and live.\\n Right now, it may seem hard to believe that AI could have a large impact on our\\nworld, because it isn’t yet widely deployed—much as, back in 1995, it would have been\\ndifficult to believe in the future impact of  the internet. Back then, most people didn’t\\nsee how the internet was relevant to them and how it was going to change their lives. The\\nsame is true for deep learning and AI today.

It’s safe to say that most of the mach ine-learning algorithms used in the industry\\ntoday aren’t deep-learning algorithms. Deep le arning isn’t always the right tool for the\\njob—sometimes there isn’t enough data for de ep learning to be applicable, and some-\\ntimes the problem is better solved by a diff erent algorithm. If d eep learning is your\\nfirst contact with machine learning, then you may find yourself in a situation where all\\nyou have is the deep-learning hammer, and every machine-learning problem starts to\\nlook like a nail. The only way not to fall into this trap is to be familiar with other\\napproaches and practice them when appropriate.\\n A detailed discussion of classical machin e-learning approaches is outside of the\\nscope of this book, but we’ll briefly go over  them and describe the historical context\\nin which they were developed. This will allo w us to place deep learning in the broader\\ncontext of machine learning and better un derstand where deep learning comes from\\nand why it matters.\\n1.2.1 Probabilistic modeling\\nProbabilistic modeling  is the application of the principles  of statistics to data analysis. It\\nwas one of the earliest forms of machine learni ng, and it’s still widely used to this day.\\nOne of the best-known algorithms in this category is the Naive Bayes algorithm.\\n Naive Bayes is a type of machine-learning classifier based on applying Bayes’ theo-\\nrem while assuming that the fe atures in the input data are all independent (a strong,\\nor “naive” assumption, which is where the na me comes from). This form of data analy-\\nsis predates computers and was applied by hand decade s before its first computer\\nimplementation (most likely dating back to the 1950s). Bayes’ theorem and the foun-\\ndations of statistics date back to the eighteenth century, and these are all you need tostart using Naive Bayes classifiers.\\n A closely related model is the logistic regression  (logreg for short) , which is some-\\ntimes considered to be the “hello world” of modern machine learning. Don’t be mis-\\nled by its name—logreg is a classification algorithm rather than a regression\\nalgorithm. Much like Naive Bayes, logreg pr edates computing by a long time, yet it’s\\nstill useful to this day, thanks  to its simple and versatile nature. It’s often the first thing\\na data scientist will try on a dataset to get a feel for the classifi cation task at hand. \\n1.2.2 Early neural networks\\nEarly iterations of neural networks have  been completely supplanted by the modern\\nvariants covered in these pages, but it’s help ful to be aware of how deep learning origi-\\nnated. Although the core ideas of neural netw orks were investigated in toy forms as early\\nas the 1950s, the approach took decades to ge t started. For a long time, the missing piece\\nwas an efficient way to trai n large neural networks. This changed in the mid-1980s,\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 36}),\n",

The resultin g network, dubbed LeNet , was used by the United States Postal Ser-\\nvice in the 1990s to automate the reading of ZIP codes on mail envelopes. \\n1.2.3 Kernel methods\\nAs neural networks started to gain some  respect among researchers in the 1990s,\\nthanks to this first success, a new approa ch to machine learning rose to fame and\\nquickly sent neural nets back to oblivion: kernel methods. Kernel methods  are a group of\\nclassification algorithms, the best known of which is the support vector machine  (SVM).\\nThe modern formulation of an SVM was developed by Vladimir\\nVapnik and Corinna Cortes in the early 1990s at Bell Labs and\\npublished in 1995,2 although an older li near formulation was\\npublished by Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis as early as 1963.3\\n SVMs aim at solving classificati on problems by finding good\\ndecision boundaries  (see figure 1.10) between two sets of points\\nbelonging to two different cate gories. A decision boundary can\\nbe thought of as a line or surf ace separating your training data\\ninto two spaces corresponding to two categories. To classify new\\ndata points, you just need to check which side of the decisionboundary they fall on.\\n \\nSVMs proceed to find these boundaries in two steps:\\n1The data is mapped to a new high-dimensional representation where the\\ndecision boundary can be expressed as a hyperplane (if the data was two-\\ndimensional, as in figure 1.10, a hy perplane would be a straight line).\\n2A good decision boundary (a separation hyperplane) is com puted by trying to\\nmaximize the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from\\neach class, a step called maximizing the margin . This allows the boundary to gen-\\neralize well to new samples outs ide of the training dataset.\\nThe technique of mapping data to a high-dim ensional representation where a classifi-\\ncation problem becomes simpler may look good on paper, but in practice it’s\\noften computationally intrac table. That’s where the kernel trick  comes in (the key idea\\nthat kernel methods are named after).

A kernel function is a computationa lly tractable operat ion that maps any\\ntwo points in your initial space to the di stance between these points in your target\\nrepresentation space, completely bypassing  the explicit computation of the new rep-\\nresentation. Kernel functions are typically crafted by hand rather than learned from\\ndata—in the case of an SVM, only the separation hyperplane is learned.\\n At the time they were developed, SVMs exhibited state-of-the-art performance on\\nsimple classification problems and were one of the few machine-learning methods\\nbacked by extensive theory and amenable to serious mathematical analysis, making\\nthem well understood and easily interpreta ble. Because of these useful properties,\\nSVMs became extremely popular in the field for a long time.\\n But SVMs proved hard to scale to large datase ts and didn’t provide good results for\\nperceptual problems such as im age classification. Because an SVM is a shallow\\nmethod, applying an SVM to perceptual problems requires first extracting useful rep-\\nresentations manually (a step called feature engineering ), which is difficult and brittle. \\n1.2.4 Decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines\\nDecision trees  are flowchart-like structur es that let you classify input data points or pre-\\ndict output values given inputs (see figure 1.11). They’re easy to visualize and inter-\\npret. Decisions trees learned from data began to receive significant research interest\\nin the 2000s, and by 2010 they were often preferred to kernel methods.\\nIn particular, the Random Forest  algorithm introduced a robust, practical take on\\ndecision-tree learning that involves buildi ng a large number of specialized decision\\ntrees and then ensembling their outputs. Random forests are a pplicable to a wide\\nrange of problems—you could say that they’r e almost always the second-best algorithm\\nfor any shallow machine-learning task. When the popular machine-learning competi-tion website Kaggle ( http:/ /kaggle.com ) got started in 2010, random forests quickly\\nbecame a favorite on the platform—until 2014, when gradient boosting machines  took\\nover.

It may be one of the best, if not the best, algorithm for dealing with nonperceptual\\ndata today. Alongside deep learning, it’s one of the most commonly used techniques in\\nKaggle competitions. \\n1.2.5 Back to neural networks\\nAround 2010, although neural networks we re almost completely shunned by the sci-\\ne n t i f i c  c o m m u n i t y  a t  l a r g e ,  a  n u m b e r  o f  p e o p l e  s t i l l  w o r k i n g  o n  n e u r a l  n e t w o r k s\\nstarted to make important breakthroughs: th e groups of Geoffrey Hinton at the Uni-\\nversity of Toronto, Yoshua Bengio at the University of Montreal, Yann LeCun at New\\nYork University, and IDSIA  in Switzerland.\\n In 2011, Dan Ciresan from IDSIA  began to win academic image-classification com-\\npetitions with GPU-trained deep neural networks—the first practical success of mod-\\nern deep learning. But the watershed mo ment came in 2012, with the entry of\\nHinton’s group in the yearly large-scale im age-classification ch allenge ImageNet. The\\nImageNet challenge was notoriousl y difficult at the time, consisting of classifying high-\\nresolution color images into 1,000 different categories after training on 1.4 million\\nimages. In 2011, the top-five accuracy of  the winning model, based on classical\\napproaches to computer vision, was only 74.3%. Then, in 2012, a team led by Alex\\nKrizhevsky and advised by Geo ffrey Hinton was able to ac hieve a top-five accuracy of\\n83.6%—a significant breakthrough. The co mpetition has been dominated by deep\\nconvolutional neural networks  every year since. By 2015, the winner reached an accu-\\nracy of 96.4%, and the classification task  on ImageNet was cons idered to be a com-\\npletely solved problem.\\n Since 2012, deep convolut ional neural networks ( convnets ) have become the go-to\\nalgorithm for all computer vision tasks; mo re generally, they work on all perceptual\\ntasks. At major computer vi sion conferences in 2015 and 2016, it was nearly impossi-\\nble to find presentations that didn’t involv e convnets in some form. At the same time,\\ndeep learning has also found applications in many other types of problems, such as\\nnatural-language processing. It has completely replaced SVMs and decision trees in a\\nwide range of applications. For instance, for several year s, the European Organization\\nfor Nuclear Research, CERN , used decision tree–based me thods for analysis of particle\\ndata from the ATLAS  detector at the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC); but CERN  eventu-\\nally switched to Keras-base d deep neural networks due to their higher performance\\nand ease of training on large datasets. \\n1.2.6 What makes deep learning different\\nThe primary reason deep learning took off so  quickly is that it offered better perfor-\\nmance on many problems.

But the refined representa tions required by co mplex problems gener-\\nally can’t be attained by such techniques. As such, humans had to go to great lengths\\nto make the initial input data more amenab le to processing by these methods: they\\nhad to manually engineer good layers of representations for their data. This is called\\nfeature engineering . Deep learning, on the other hand , completely automates this step:\\nwith deep learning, you learn all features in one pass rather than having to engineer\\nthem yourself. This has greatly simplified machine-learning workflows, often replac-\\ning sophisticated multistage pipelines with a single, simple, end-to-end deep-learningmodel.\\n You may ask, if the crux of the issue is to have multiple successive layers of repre-\\nsentations, could shallow methods be appl ied repeatedly to emulate the effects of\\ndeep learning? In practice, there are fast-diminishing re turns to successive applica-\\ntions of shallow-learning methods, because the optimal first representation layer in a three-\\nlayer model isn’t the optimal first lay er in a one-layer or two-layer model . What is transforma-\\ntive about deep learning is th at it allows a model to learn all layers of representation\\njointly , at the same time, rather than in succession ( greedily , as it’s called). With joint\\nfeature learning, whenever the model adjusts one of its internal features, all other fea-\\ntures that depend on it automatically ad apt to the change, without requiring human\\nintervention. Everything is supervised by a single feedback signal: every change in the\\nmodel serves the end goal. This is much more  powerful than greed ily stacking shallow\\nmodels, because it allows for complex, ab stract representations to be learned by\\nb re aki ng t hem  do wn i nto  lo ng s e rie s  o f intermediate spaces (layers); each space is\\nonly a simple transformation away from the previous one.\\n These are the two essential characteristics of how deep learning learns from data:\\nthe incremental, layer-by-layer way in which incr easingly complex representations are developed ,\\nand the fact that these intermediate incremental representations are learned jointly , each layer\\nbeing updated to follow both the representational needs of the layer above and theneeds of the layer below. Together, these two properties have made deep learning\\nvastly more successful than previous  approaches to machine learning. \\n1.2.7 The modern machine-learning landscape\\nA great way to get a sense of the current landscape of machine-learning algorithms\\nand tools is to look at machine-learning competitions on Kaggle. Due to its highly\\ncompetitive environment (some contests ha ve thousands of entrants and million-\\ndollar prizes) and to the wide variety of  machine-learning problems covered, Kaggle\\noffers a realistic way to assess what works an d what doesn’t.

What changed in these two decades?\\n In general, three technical forces are driving advances in machine learning:\\n\\uf0a1Hardware\\n\\uf0a1Datasets and benchmarks\\n\\uf0a1Algorithmic advances\\nBecause the field is guided by experimental findings rather than by theory, algorith-\\nmic advances only become possible when ap propriate data and hardware are available\\nto try new ideas (or scale up old ideas, as is often the case). Machine learning isn’t\\nmathematics or physics, wher e major advances can be done with a pen and a piece of\\npaper. It’s an engineering science.\\n The real bottlenecks throughout the 1990s and 2000s were data and hardware. But\\nhere’s what happened during  that time: the internet to ok off, and high-performance\\ngraphics chips were developed for the needs of the gaming market.\\n1.3.1 Hardware\\nBetween 1990 and 2010, off-the-shelf CPUs became faster by a factor of approximately\\n5,000. As a result, nowadays it’s possible to run small deep-learning models on your\\nlaptop, whereas this would have been intractable 25 years ago.\\n But typical deep-learning models used in  computer vision or speech recognition\\nrequire orders of magnitude more computational power th an what your laptop can\\ndeliver.

In 2016, at its\\nannual I/O convention, Google revealed its tensor processing unit ( TPU) project: a\\nnew chip design developed from the ground up to run deep neural networks, which is\\nreportedly 10 times faster and far more energy efficient than top-of-the-line GPUs. \\n1.3.2 Data\\nAI is sometimes heralded as th e new industrial revolution. If  deep learning is the steam\\nengine of this revolution, then data is its coal: the raw material that powers our intelli-\\ngent machines, without which nothing would be possible. When it comes to data, in\\naddition to the exponential progress in stor age hardware over the past 20 years (fol-\\nlowing Moore’s law), the game changer has been  the rise of the internet, making it fea-\\nsible to collect and distribute  very large datasets for machine learning. Today, large\\ncompanies work with image datasets, video da tasets, and natural-language datasets that\\ncouldn’t have been collected without th e internet. User-generated image tags on\\nFlickr, for instance, have been a treasure tr ove of data for computer vision. So are You-\\nTube videos.

By 2014, it had risen to a staggering\\n$394 million. Dozens of startups launched in these three years, trying to capitalize onthe deep-learning hype. Mean while, large tech companies such as Google, Facebook,\\nBaidu, and Microsoft have invested in inte rnal research depart ments in amounts that\\nwould most likely dwarf the flow of vent ure-capital money.

In addition, deep-learning\\nmodels are trained by iterating over small  batches of data, allowing them to be\\ntrained on datasets of arbitrary size.

In general, all current machin e-learning systems use tensors\\nas their basic data structur e. Tensors are fundamental to  the field—so fundamental\\nthat Google’s TensorFlow was name d after them. So what’s a tensor?\\n At its core, a tensor is a container for data—almost always numerical data. So, it’s a\\ncontainer for numbers. You may be already familiar with matrices, which are 2D ten-\\nsors: tensors are a generalization of matric es to an arbitrary number of dimensions\\n(note that in the context of tensors, a dimension  is often called an axis).\\n2.2.1 Scalars (0D tensors)\\nA tensor that contains only one number is called a scalar  (or scalar tensor, or 0-dimensional\\ntensor, or 0D tensor). In Numpy, a float32  or float64  number is a scalar  tensor (or scalar\\narray). You can display the number of  axes of a Numpy tensor via the ndim  attribute; a sca-\\nlar tensor has 0 axes ( ndim == 0 ). The number of axes of a tensor is also called its rank.\\nHere’s a Numpy scalar:\\n>>> import numpy as np\\n>>> x = np.array(12)>>> xarray(12)>>> x.ndim\\n0\\n2.2.2 Vectors (1D tensors)\\nAn array of numbers is called a vector , or 1D tensor. A 1D tensor is said to have exactly\\none axis. Following is a Numpy vector:\\n>>> x = np.array([12, 3, 6, 14])\\n>>> x\\narray([12, 3, 6, 14])>>> x.ndim1\\nThis vector has five entr ies and so is called a 5-dimensional vector . Don’t confuse a 5D\\nvector with a 5D tensor! A 5D vector has only one axis and has five dimensions along its\\naxis, whereas a 5D tensor has five axes (and ma y have any number of dimensions\\nalong each axis). Dimensionality  can denote either the number of entries along a spe-\\ncific axis (as in the case of our 5D vector) or the number of axes in a tensor (such as a\\n5D tensor), which can be confusing at time s. In the latter case, it’s technically more\\ncorrect to talk about a tensor of rank 5  (the rank of a tensor being the number of axes),\\nbut the ambiguous notation 5D tensor  is common regardless. \\n2.2.3 Matrices (2D tensors)\\nAn array of vectors is a matrix , or 2D tensor. A matrix has two axes (often referred to\\nrows and columns ). You can visually interpret a matrix  as a rectangular grid of numbers.\\nThis is a Numpy matrix:\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n",

Following is a Numpy 3D tensor:\\n>>> x = np.array([[[5, 78, 2, 34, 0],\\n[6, 79, 3, 35, 1],\\n[7, 80, 4, 36, 2]],\\n[[5, 78, 2, 34, 0],\\n[6, 79, 3, 35, 1],\\n[7, 80, 4, 36, 2]],\\n[[5, 78, 2, 34, 0],\\n[6, 79, 3, 35, 1],\\n[7, 80, 4, 36, 2]]])\\n>>> x.ndim3\\nBy packing 3D tensors in an array, you can create a 4D tensor, and so on. In deep learn-\\ning, you’ll generally manipulate tensors that are 0D to 4D, although you may go up to\\n5D if you process video data. \\n2.2.5 Key attributes\\nA tensor is defined by three key attributes:\\n\\uf0a1Number of axes (rank) —For instance, a 3D tensor has three axes, and a matrix has\\ntwo axes. This is also called the tensor’s ndim  in Python libraries such as Numpy.\\n\\uf0a1Shape —This is a tuple of integers that de scribes how many dimensions the ten-\\nsor has along each axis. For instance, the previous matrix example has shape\\n(3, 5), and the 3D tensor example has shape (3, 3, 5). A vector has a shape\\nwith a single element, such as (5,) , whereas a scalar has an empty shape, ().\\n\\uf0a1Data type  (usually called dtype  in Python libraries)—This is the type of the data\\ncontained in the tensor; for inst ance, a tensor’s type could be float32 , uint8 ,\\nfloat64 , and so on. On rare o ccasions, you may see a char  tensor.

Selecting specific elements in a tensor is called tensor slicing .\\nLet’s look at the tensor-slicing oper ations you can do on Numpy arrays.\\n The following example selects digits #10 to #100 (#100 isn’t included) and puts\\nthem in an array of shape (90, 28, 28) :\\n>>> my_slice = train_images[10:100]\\n>>> print(my_slice.shape)(90, 28, 28)\\nIt’s equivalent to this more detailed nota tion, which specifies a start index and stop\\nindex for the slice along each tensor axis.

For\\ninstance, in order to select 14 × 14 pixels in the bottom-right corner of all images, you\\ndo this:\\nmy_slice = train_images[:, 14:, 14:]\\nIt’s also possible to use negative indices. Much like negative indices in Python lists,\\nthey indicate a position relative to the end of the current axis. In order to crop the\\nimages to patches of 14 × 14 pixels centered in the middle, you do this:\\nmy_slice = train_images[:, 7:-7, 7:-7]\\n2.2.7 The notion of data batches\\nIn general, the first axis (axis 0, because inde xing starts at 0) in all data tensors you’ll\\ncome across in deep learning will be the samples axis  (sometimes called the samples\\ndimension ). In the MNIST  example, samples are images of digits.\\n In addition, deep-learning models don’t pr ocess an entire dataset at once; rather,\\nthey break the data into small batches.  Concretely, here’s one batch of our MNIST  dig-\\nits, with batch size of 128:\\nbatch = train_images[:128]\\nAnd here’s the next batch:\\nbatch = train_images[128:256]\\nAnd the nth batch:\\nbatch = train_images[128 * n:128 * (n + 1)]Equivalent to the \\nprevious example\\nAlso equivalent to the \\nprevious example\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 56}),\n",

In such a data set, each single data point can be encoded\\nas a vector, and thus a batch of data will be encoded as a 2D tensor (that is, an array of\\nvectors), where the first axis is the samples axis  and the second axis is the features axis .\\n Let’s take a look at two examples:\\n\\uf0a1An actuarial dataset of people, wher e we consider each person’s age, ZIP code,\\nand income. Each person can be characterized as a vector of 3 values, and thusan entire dataset of 100,000 people can be stored in a \\n2D tensor of shape\\n(100000, 3) .\\n\\uf0a1A dataset of text documents, where we represent each document by the counts\\nof how many times each word appears in it (out of a dictionary of 20,000 com-\\nmon words).

In this setting, each character can\\nbe encoded as a binary vector of size 128  (an all-zeros vector except for a 1 entry\\nat the index corresponding to the character). Then each tweet can be encoded\\nas a 2D tensor of shape (280, 128) , and a dataset of 1 million tweets can be\\nstored in a tensor of shape (1000000, 280, 128) . \\n2.2.11 Image data\\nImages typically have three dimensions: he ight, width, and color depth. Although\\ngrayscale images (like our MNIST  digits) have only a single color channel and could\\nthus be stored in 2D tensors, by convention image tensors are always 3D, with a one-\\ndimensional color channel for grayscale im ages.

The Tensor-\\nFlow machine-learning framework, from G oogle, places the color-depth axis at the\\nend: (samples, height, width, color_depth) .

For instance, it’s possible to add tensor s, multiply tensors,\\nand so on.\\n In our initial example, we were building our network by stacking Dense  layers on\\ntop of each other. A Keras layer instance looks like this:\\nkeras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu')\\nThis layer can be interpreted as a function, which takes as input a 2D tensor and\\nreturns another 2D tensor—a new representation for the input tensor. Specifically, the\\nfunction is as follows (where W is a 2D tensor and b is a vector, both attributes of the\\nlayer):\\noutput = relu(dot(W, input) + b)\\nLet’s unpack this. We have three tens or operations here: a dot product ( dot) between\\nthe input tensor and a tensor named W; an addition ( +) between the resulting 2D ten-\\nsor and a vector b; and, finally, a relu  operation. relu(x)  is max(x, 0) .\\nNOTE Although this section deals entirely with linear algebra expressions,\\nyou won’t find any mathematical notation here. I’ve found that mathematicalconcepts can be more readily mastered  by programmers with no mathemati-\\ncal background if they’re expressed as short Python snippets  instead of math-\\nematical equations. So we’ll use Numpy code throughout.\\n2.3.1 Element-wise operations\\nThe relu  operation and addition are element-wise  operations: operations that are\\napplied independently to each entry in the tensors being considered. This means\\nthese operations are highly amenable to massively parallel implementations ( vectorized\\nimplementations, a term that comes from the vector processor  supercomputer archi-\\ntecture from the 1970–1990 period). If you want to write a naive Python imple-\\nmentation of an element-wise operation, you use a for loop, as in this naive\\nimplementation of an element-wise relu  operation:\\ndef naive_relu(x):\\nassert len(x.shape) == 2\\nx = x.copy()\\nfor i in range(x.shape[0]):\\nfor j in range(x.shape[1]):\\nx[i, j] = max(x[i, j], 0)\\nreturn xx is a 2D Numpy tensor.\\nAvoid overwriting the input tensor.\\nLicensed to   <null>\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 60}),\n",

BLAS  are low-level, highly parallel, efficient tensor-manipulation\\nroutines that are typically implemented in Fortran or C.\\n So, in Numpy, you can do the following el ement-wise operation, and it will be blaz-\\ning fast:\\nimport numpy as np\\nz=x+yz = np.maximum(z, 0.)\\n2.3.2 Broadcasting\\nOur earlier naive implementation of naive_add  only supports the addition of 2D ten-\\nsors with identical shapes. But in the Dense  layer introduced earlier, we added a 2D\\ntensor with a vector. What happens with ad dition when the shapes of the two tensors\\nbeing added differ?\\n When possible, and if there’s no ambiguity, the smaller tensor will be broadcasted  to\\nmatch the shape of the larger tensor. Broadcasting consists of two steps:\\n1Axes (called broadcast axes ) are added to the smaller tensor to match the ndim  of\\nthe larger tensor.\\n2The smaller tensor is repeated alongsid e these new axes to match the full shape\\nof the larger tensor.\\nLet’s look at a concre te example. Consider X with shape (32,  10) and y with shape\\n(10,) . First, we add an empty first axis to y, whose shape becomes (1, 10). Then, we\\nrepeat y 32 times alongside this new axis, so  that we end up with a tensor Y with shape\\n(32, 10) , where Y[i,  :] == y for i in range(0,  32). At this point, we can proceed to\\nadd X and Y, because they have the same shape.\\n In terms of implementation, no new 2D tensor is created, because that would be\\nterribly inefficient. The repetition operation is  entirely virtual: it happens at the algo-\\nrithmic level rather than at the memory level.

They’re called\\nthe weights  or trainable parameters  of the layer (the kernel  and bias  attributes, respec-\\ntively). These weights contain the informat ion learned by the network from exposure\\nto training data.\\n Initially, these weight matrices are filled with small random values (a step called ran-\\ndom initialization ). Of course, there’s no reason to expect that relu(dot(W,  input)  + b),\\nwhen W and b are random, will yield any useful re presentations. The resulting represen-\\ntations are meaningless—but they’re a starting  point. What comes ne xt is to gradually\\nadjust these weights, based on a feedback signal. This gradual ad justment, also called\\ntraining , is basically the learning that  machine learning is all about.\\n This happens within what’s called a training loop , which works as follows. Repeat\\nthese steps in a loop, as long as necessary:\\n1Draw a batch of training samples x and corresponding targets y.\\n2Run the network on x (a step called the forward pass ) to obtain predictions y_pred .\\n3Compute the loss of the network on the batch, a measure of the mismatch\\nbetween y_pred  and y.\\n4Update all weights of the network in a wa y that slightly reduces the loss on this\\nbatch.\\nYou’ll eventually end up with a network that has a very low loss on its training data: a\\nlow mismatch between predictions y_pred  and expected targets y.

Steps 2 and 3 are merely the applica-\\ntion of a handful of tensor operations, so you could implement these steps purely\\nfrom what you learned in the previous section. The difficult part is step 4: updating\\nthe network’s weights.

A much bet-\\nter approach is to take advantage of the fa ct that all operations used in the network\\nare differentiable , and compute the gradient  of the loss with regard to the network’s\\ncoefficients. You can then move the coeffici ents in the opposite direction from the\\ngradient, thus de creasing the loss.\\n If you already know what differentiable  means and what a gradient  is, you can skip to\\nsection 2.4.3. Otherwise, the following two sections will help you understand these\\nconcepts.\\n2.4.1 What’s a derivative?\\nConsider a continuous, smooth function f(x) = y , mapping a real number x to a new\\nreal number y. Because the function is continuous , a small change in x can only result\\nin a small change in y—that’s the intuition behind cont inuity. Let’s say you increase x\\nby a small factor epsilon_x : this results in a small epsilon_y  change to y:\\nf(x + epsilon_x) = y + epsilon_y\\nIn addition, because the function is smooth  (its curve doesn’t ha ve any abrupt angles),\\nwhen epsilon_x  is small enough, around a certain point p, it’s possible to approxi-\\nmate f as a linear function of slope a, so that epsilon_y  becomes a * epsilon_x :\\nf(x + epsilon_x) = y + a * epsilon_x\\nObviously, this linear approximation is valid only when x is close enough to p.\\n The slope a is called the derivative  of f in p. If a is negative, it means a small change\\nof x around p will result in a decrease of f(x)  (as shown in figure 2.10); and if a is pos-\\nitive, a small change in x will result in an increase of f(x) . Further, the absolute value\\nof a (the magnitude  of the derivative) tells you how quickly this increase or decrease\\nwill happen.\\nFor every differentiable function f(x)  (differentiable  means “can be de rived”: for exam-\\nple, smooth, continuous functions can be de rived), there exists a derivative function\\nf'(x)  that maps values of x to the slope of the local linear approximation of f in thoseLocal linear\\napproximation of f,\\nwith slope a\\nfFigure 2.10 Derivative of f in p\\nLicensed to   <null>\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 69}),\n",

For instance, the derivative of cos(x)  is -sin(x) , the derivative of f(x)  = a * x\\nis f'(x)  = a, and so on.\\n If you’re trying to update x by a factor epsilon_x  in order to minimize f(x) , and\\nyou know the derivative of f, then your job is done: the derivative completely\\ndescribes how f(x)  evolves as you change x. If you want to reduce the value of f(x) ,\\nyou just need to move x a little in the opposite direction from the derivative. \\n2.4.2 Derivative of a tensor  operation: the gradient\\nA gradient  is the derivative of a tensor operatio n. It’s the generalization of the concept\\nof derivatives to functions of multidimension al inputs: that is, to functions that take\\ntensors as inputs.\\n Consider an input vector x, a matrix W, a target y, and a loss function loss . You can\\nuse W to compute a target candidate y_pred , and compute the loss, or mismatch,\\nbetween the target candidate y_pred  and the target y:\\ny_pred = dot(W, x)\\nloss_value = loss(y_pred, y)\\nIf the data inputs x and y are frozen, then this can be interpreted as a function map-\\nping values of W to loss values:\\nloss_value = f(W)\\nLet’s say the current value of W is W0. Then the derivative of f in the point W0 is a tensor\\ngradient(f)(W0)  with the same shape as W, where each coefficient gradient(f)\\n(W0)[i,  j] indicates the direction and magnitude of the change in loss_value  you\\nobserve when modifying W0[i,  j]. That tensor gradient(f)(W0)  is the gradient of\\nthe function f(W)  = loss_value  in W0.\\n You saw earlier that the derivative of a function f(x)  of a single coefficient can be\\ninterpreted as the slope of the curve of f. Likewise, gradient(f)(W0)  can be inter-\\npreted as the tensor describing the curvature  of f(W)  around W0.\\n For this reason, in much the same way that, for a function f(x) , you can reduce\\nthe value of f(x)  by moving x a little in the opposite direction from the derivative,\\nwith a function f(W)  of a tensor, you can reduce f(W)  by moving W in the opposite\\ndirection from the gradient: for example, W1 = W0 - step  * gradient(f)(W0)  (where\\nstep  is a small scaling factor). That means going against the curvature, which intui-\\ntively should put you lower on the cu rve. Note that the scaling factor step  is needed\\nbecause gradient(f)(W0)  only approximates the curv ature when you’re close to W0,\\nso you don’t want to get too far from W0. \\n2.4.3 Stochastic gradient descent\\nGiven a differentiable function, it’s theoreti cally possible to find its minimum analyti-\\ncally: it’s known that a function’s minimum is  a point where the derivative is 0, so all\\nyou have to do is find all the points where the derivative goes to 0 and check for which\\nof these points the function has the lowest value.\\nLicensed to   <null>\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 70}),\n",

The efficient compromise\\nbetween these two extremes is to us e mini-batches of reasonable size.\\n Although figure 2.11 illustr ates gradient descent in a 1D parameter space, in prac-\\ntice you’ll use gradient descent in highly dimensional spaces: every weight coefficient\\nin a neural network is a free dimension in the space, and there may be tens of thou-\\nsands or even millions of them. To help you build intuition about loss surfaces, you\\ncan also visualize gradient descent along a 2D loss surface, as shown in figure 2.12. But\\nyou can’t possibly visualize what the actual process of training a neural network looks\\nlike—you can’t represent a 1,000,000-dimensional space in a way that makes sense to\\nhumans. As such, it’s good to keep in mi nd that the intuitions you develop through\\nthese low-dimensional representations may no t always be accurate in practice. This\\nhas historically been a source of issues  in the world of deep-learning research.\\nAdditionally, there exist multiple variants of SGD that differ by taking into account\\nprevious weight updates when computing the next weight update, rather than just\\nlooking at the current value of the gradients. There is, for instance, SGD with momen-\\ntum, as well as Adagrad, RMSP rop, and several others. Such variants are known as opti-\\nmization methods  or optimizers . In particular, the concept of momentum , which is used in\\nmany of these variants, deserves your atte ntion. Momentum addr esses two issues with\\nSGD: convergence speed and local minima.

Building deep-learning models in Keras is\\ndone by clipping together compatible layers  to form useful data-transformation pipe-\\nlines. The notion of layer compatibility  here refers specifically to  the fact that every layer\\nwill only accept input tensors of a certain sh ape and will return ou tput tensors of a cer-\\ntain shape. Consider the following example:\\nfrom keras import layers\\nlayer = layers.Dense(32, input_shape=(784,))\\nWe’re creating a layer that will only accept as input 2D tensors where the first dimen-\\nsion is 784 (axis 0, the batch dimension, is unspecified, and thus any value would beaccepted). This layer will return a tensor  where the first dimension has been trans-\\nformed to be 32.\\n Thus this layer can only be connected to a downstream layer that expects 32-\\ndimensional vectors as its input. When us ing Keras, you don’t have to worry about\\ncompatibility, because the layers you add to your models are dynamically built to\\nmatch the shape of the incoming layer. Fo r instance, suppose you write the following:\\nfrom keras import models\\nfrom keras import layers\\nmodel = models.Sequential()\\nmodel.add(layers.Dense(32, input_shape=(784,)))\\nmodel.add(layers.Dense(32))\\nThe second layer didn’t receive an input shape argument—instead , it automatically\\ninferred its input shape as being the outp ut shape of the layer that came before. \\n3.1.2 Models: networks of layers\\nA deep-learning model is a directed, ac yclic graph of layers.

Instead, it relie s on a specialized, well-optimized tensor\\nlibrary to do so, serving as the backend engine  of Keras. Rather than choosing a single\\ntensor library and tying the implementation of  Keras to that library, Keras handles the\\nproblem in a modular way (see figure 3.3); thus several different backend engines can\\nbe plugged seamlessly into Keras. Currentl y, the three existing backend implementa-\\ntions are the TensorFlow backend, the Thea no backend, and the Microsoft Cognitive\\nToolkit ( CNTK ) backend. In the future, it’s likely that Keras will be extended to work\\nwith even more deep-lea rning execution engines.\\nTensorFlow, CNTK , and Theano are some of the pr imary platforms for deep learning\\ntoday. Theano ( http:/ /deeplearning. net/software/theano ) is developed by the MILA\\nlab at Université de Montréal , TensorFlow ( www.tensorflow.org ) is developed by Google,\\nand CNTK  (https:/ /github.com/Microsoft/ CNTK ) is developed by Microsoft. Any\\npiece of code that you write with Keras can be run with any of these backends without\\nhaving to change anything in the code: you can seamlessly switch between the two\\nduring development, which often proves usef ul—for instance, if one of these backends\\nproves to be faster for a sp ecific task. We recommend us ing the TensorFlow backend as\\nthe default for most of your deep-learning ne eds, because it’s the most widely adopted,\\nscalable, and production ready.\\n Via TensorFlow (or Theano, or CNTK ), Keras is able to run seamlessly on both\\nCPUs and GPUs.

Do this if\\nyou don’t already have a GPU on your local machine. Appendix B provides a\\nstep-by-step guide.\\n\\uf0a1Install everything from scratch on a lo cal Unix workstation. You can then run\\neither local Jupyter notebooks or a regu lar Python codebase. Do this if you\\nalready have a high-end NVIDIA  GPU. Appendix A provides an Ubuntu-specific,\\nstep-by-step guide.\\nLet’s take a closer look at some of the compromises involved in picking one option\\nover the other. \\n3.3.3 Running deep-learning jobs  in the cloud: pros and cons\\nIf you don’t already have a GPU that you can use for deep learning (a recent, high-end\\nNVIDIA  GPU), then running deep-learning experi ments in the cloud is a simple, low-\\ncost way for you to get started without having to buy any additional hardware. If you’reusing Jupyter notebooks, the experience of running in the cloud is no different from\\nrunning locally. As of mid-2017, the cloud o ffering that makes it easiest to get started\\nwith deep learning is definitely \\nAWS EC2. Appendix B provides a step-by-step guide to\\nrunning Jupyter notebooks on a EC2 GPU instance.\\n But if you’re a heavy user of deep learni ng, this setup isn’t sustainable in the long\\nterm—or even for more than a few weeks. EC2 instances are expensive: the instance\\ntype recommended in appendix B (the p2.xlarge  instance, which won’t provide you\\nwith much power) costs $0.90 per hour as of mid-2017. Meanwhil e, a solid consumer-\\nclass GPU will cost you somewher e between $1,000 and $1, 500—a price that has been\\nfairly stable over time, even as the specs of these GPUs keep improving. If you’re serious\\nabout deep learning, you should set up a local workstation with one or more GPUs.\\n In short, EC2 is a great way to get started. Yo u could follow the code examples in\\nthis book entirely on an EC2 GPU instance. But if you’re going to be a power user of\\ndeep learning, get your own GPUs. \\n3.3.4 What is the best GPU for deep learning?\\nIf you’re going to buy a GPU, which one should you choose? The first thing to note is\\nthat it must be an NVIDIA  GPU. NVIDIA  is the only graphics  computing company that\\nhas invested heavily in deep learning so  far, and modern deep-learning frameworks\\ncan only run on NVIDIA  cards.\\n As of mid-2017, we recommend the NVIDIA  TITAN  Xp as the best card on the mar-\\nket for deep learning. For lower budg ets, you may want to consider the GTX 1060. If\\nyou’re reading these pages in 2018 or later,  take the time to look online for fresher\\nrecommendations, because new mo dels come out every year.\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 88}),\n",

In this exampl e, you’ll learn to classify movie reviews as\\npositive or negative, based on the text content of the reviews.\\n3.4.1 The IMDB dataset\\nYou’ll work with the IMDB  dataset: a set of 50,000 highly polarized reviews from the\\nInternet Movie Database. They’re split into  25,000 reviews for training and 25,000\\nreviews for testing, each se t consisting of 50% negative  and 50% positive reviews.\\n Why use separate training and test sets ? Because you should never test a machine-\\nlearning model on the same data that you used to train it! Just because a model per-\\nforms well on its training data doesn’t mean it will perform well on data it has neverseen; and what you care about is your mode l’s performance on new data (because you\\nalready know the labels of your training data—obviously you don’t need your model\\nto predict those). For instance, it’s possible that your model could end up merely mem-\\norizing  a mapping between your training samp les and their targets, which would be\\nuseless for the task of pred icting targets for data the model has never seen before.\\nWe’ll go over this point in much more detail in the next chapter.\\n Just like the \\nMNIST  dataset, the IMDB  dataset comes packaged with Keras. It has\\nalready been preprocessed: the reviews (seq uences of words) have been turned into\\nsequences of integers, where each integer st ands for a specific word in a dictionary.\\n The following code will load the datase t (when you run it the first time, about\\n80MB of data will be downloaded to your machine).\\nfrom keras.datasets import imdb\\n(train_data, train_labels), (test_data, test_labels) = imdb.load_data(\\nnum_words=10000)\\nThe argument num_words=10000  means you’ll only keep the top 10,000 most fre-\\nquently occurring words in the training data. Rare words will be discarded. This allows\\nyou to work with vector data of manageable size.\\n The variables train_data  and test_data  are lists of reviews; each review is a list of\\nword indices (encoding a sequence of words). train_labels  and test_labels  are\\nlists of 0s and 1s, where 0 stands for negative  and 1 stands for positive :\\n>>> train_data[0]\\n[1, 14, 22, 16, ... 178, 32]\\n>>> train_labels[0]\\n1Listing 3.1 Loading the IMDB dataset\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 90}),\n",

This would\\nmean, for instance, turning the sequence [3, 5]  into a 10,000-dimensional vec-\\ntor that would be all 0s except for indi ces 3 and 5, which would be 1s.

You\\ncan intuitively understand the dimensionali ty of your representation space as “how\\nmuch freedom you’re allowing the network to  have when learning internal represen-\\ntations.” Having more hidden units (a higher-dimensional representation space)\\nallows your network to lear n more-complex representations, but it makes the network\\nmore computationally expensive and may lead  to learning unwanted patterns (pat-\\nterns that will improve performance on the training data but not on the test data).\\n There are two key architecture decision s to be made about such a stack of Dense  layers:\\n\\uf0a1How many layers to use\\n\\uf0a1How many hidden units to choose for each layer\\nIn chapter 4, you’ll learn formal principles to guide you in making these choices.

All three are instances of supervised learning , where the goal is to learn the\\nrelationship between training inputs and training targets.\\n Supervised learning is just the tip of th e iceberg—machine learning is a vast field\\nwith a complex subfield taxonomy. Machin e-learning algorithms generally fall into\\nfour broad categories, described in the following sections.\\n4.1.1 Supervised learning\\nThis is by far the most common case. It co nsists of learning to map input data to\\nknown targets (also called annotations ), given a set of examples (often annotated by\\nhumans). All four examples you’ve encounte red in this book so far were canonical\\nexamples of supervised learning. Generally,  almost all applications of deep learning\\nthat are in the spotlight these days belong in this category, such as optical character\\nrecognition, speech recognition, image classification, and language translation.\\n Although supervised learning mostly consis ts of classification and regression, there\\nare more exotic variants as well, in cluding the following (with examples):\\n\\uf0a1Sequence generation —Given a picture, predict a ca ption describing it. Sequence\\ngeneration can sometimes be reformulated as a series of classification problems\\n(such as repeatedly pr edicting a word or token in a sequence).\\n\\uf0a1Syntax tree prediction —Given a sentence, predict its decomposition into a syntax\\ntree.\\n\\uf0a1Object detection —Given a picture, draw a boundi ng box around certain objects\\ninside the picture. This can also be ex pressed as a classification problem (given\\nmany candidate bounding boxe s, classify the contents of  each one) or as a joint\\nclassification and regression problem, where the bounding-b ox coordinates are\\npredicted via vector regression.\\n\\uf0a1Image segmentation —Given a picture, draw a pixel-le vel mask on a specific object. \\n4.1.2 Unsupervised learning\\nThis branch of machine learning consists of  finding interesting transformations of the\\ninput data without the help of any targets, for the purposes of data visualization, datacompression, or data denoising, or to be tter understand the correlations present in\\nthe data at hand. Unsupervised learning is the bread and butter of data analytics, and\\nit’s often a necessary step in better understanding a da taset before attempting to solve\\na supervised-learning problem. Dimensionality reduction  and clustering  are well-known\\ncategories of unsupervised learning. \\n4.1.3 Self-supervised learning\\nThis is a specific instance of supervised learning, but it’s different enough that it\\ndeserves its own category.

There are still labels involved (because the learning has to be\\nsupervised by something), but they’re genera ted from the input data, typically using a\\nheuristic algorithm.\\n For instance, autoencoders  are a well-known instance of  self-supervised learning,\\nwhere the generated targets are the input, un modified. In the same way, trying to pre-\\ndict the next frame in a video, given past fr ames, or the next word in a text, given previ-\\nous words, are instances of self-supervised learning ( temporally supervised learning , in this\\ncase: supervision comes from future input data). Note that the distinction between\\nsupervised, self-supervised, an d unsupervised learning can be blurry sometimes—these\\ncategories are more of a continuum without solid borders. Self-supervised learning can\\nbe reinterpreted as either supervised or unsupervised learning, depending on whether\\nyou pay attention to the learning mechani sm or to the context of its application.\\nNOTE In this book, we’ll focus specifically  on supervised learning, because\\nit’s by far the dominant form of deep learning today, with a wide range of\\nindustry applications. We’ll also take a briefer look at self-supervised learning\\nin later chapters. \\n4.1.4 Reinforcement learning\\nLong overlooked, this branch of machine learning recently started to get a lot of\\nattention after Google DeepMind successfully applied it  to learning to play Atari\\ngames (and, later, learning to play Go at the highest level). In reinforcement learning,\\nan agent  receives information about its environm ent and learns to choose actions that\\nwill maximize some reward. For instance, a neur al network that “looks” at a video-\\ngame screen and outputs game actions in or der to maximize its score can be trained\\nvia reinforcement learning.\\n Currently, reinforcement learning is most ly a research area and hasn’t yet had sig-\\nnificant practical succ esses beyond games.

              " Document(page_content='97 Evaluating machine-learning models\\n4.2 Evaluating machine-learning models\\nIn the three examples presented in chapter 3,  we split the data into a training set, a\\nvalidation set, and a test set. The reason not to evaluate the models on the same datathey were trained on quickly became eviden t: after just a few epochs, all three models\\nbegan to overfit . That is, their performance on neve r-before-seen data started stalling\\n(or worsening) compared to their perfor mance on the training data—which always\\nimproves as training progresses.\\n In machine learning, the goal is to achieve models that generalize —that perform\\nwell on never-before-seen data—and overfi tting is the central obstacle. You can only\\ncontrol that which you can observe, so it’s crucial to be able to reliably measure the\\ngeneralization power of your model. The following sections look at strategies for miti-\\ngating overfitting and maximizing generalizat ion. In this section, we’ll focus on how\\nto measure generalization: how to evaluate machine-learning models.\\n4.2.1 Training, validation, and test sets\\nEvaluating a model always boils down to sp litting the available data into three sets:\\ntraining, validation, and test. You train on the training data and evaluate your model\\non the validation data. Once your model is ready for prime time, you test it one final\\ntime on the test data.\\n You may ask, why not have two sets: a training set and a test set? You’d train on the\\ntraining data and evaluate on  the test data. Much simpler!\\n The reason is that developing a model alwa ys involves tuning its configuration: for\\ne x a m p l e ,  c h o o s i n g  t h e  n u m b e r  o f  l a y e r s  o r  t h e  s i z e  o f  t h e  l a y e r s  ( c a l l e d  t h e  hyper-\\nparameters  of the model, to distinguish them from the parameters , which are the net-\\nwork’s weights). You do this tuning by using as a feedback signal the performance of\\nthe model on the validation data. In essence, this tuning is a form of learning : a search\\nfor a good configuration in some parameter space. As a result, tuning the configura-\\ntion of the model based on its performance on the validation set can quickly result in\\noverfitting to the validation set , even though your model is never directly trained on it.\\n Central to this phenomenon is the notion of information leaks . Every time you tune\\na hyperparameter of your model based on the model’s performance on the validation\\nset, some information about the validation data leaks into the model. If you do this\\nonly once, for one parameter, then very few bits of information will leak, and your val-\\nidation set will remain reliable to evalua te the model. But if you repeat this many\\ntimes—running one experiment, evaluating on  the validation set, and modifying your\\nmodel as a result—then you’ll leak an incr easingly significant am ount of information\\nabout the validation set into the model.\\n At the end of the day, you’ll end up with  a model that performs artificially well on\\nthe validation data, because that’s what you optimized it for. You care about perfor-\\nmance on completely new data, not the vali dation data, so you need to use a com-\\npletely different, never-before-seen dataset to evaluate the model: the test dataset. Your\\nmodel shouldn’t have had access to any information about the test set, even indirectly.\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 119}),\n",

Let’s review three classic evaluati on recipes: simple ho ld-out validation, K-\\nfold validation, and iterated K- fold validation with shuffling.\\nSIMPLE  HOLD-OUT VALIDATION\\nSet apart some fraction of your data as your  test set. Train on the remaining data, and\\nevaluate on the test set. As you saw in the previous sections, in order to prevent infor-\\nmation leaks, you shou ldn’t tune your model based on the test set, and therefore you\\nshould also reserve a validation set.\\n Schematically, hold-out valid ation looks like figure 4.1.

This  is easy to recognize: if different random\\nshuffling rounds of the data before splitti ng end up yielding very different measures\\nof model performance, then you’re having this issue. K-fold validation and iterated\\nK-fold validation are two ways to address this, as discussed next. \\nK-FOLD VALIDATION\\nWith this approach, you split your data into K partitions of equal size.

This method is helpful\\nwhen the performance of your model shows significant variance based on your train-\\ntest split.

In\\nsuch situations, you should always make  sure all data in your test set is posterior\\nto the data in the training set.\\n\\uf0a1Redundancy in your data —If some data points in your data appear twice (fairly\\ncommon with real-world data ), then shuffling the data and splitting it into a\\ntraining set and a validation set will result in redundancy between the training\\nand validation sets.

Many data-preprocessing and\\nfeature-engineering techniques are domain spec ific (for example, specific to text data\\nor image data); we’ll cover those in the fo llowing chapters as we encounter them in\\npractical examples. For now, we’ll review  the basics that are common to all data\\ndomains.\\n4.3.1 Data preprocessing for neural networks\\nData preprocessing aims at making the raw data at hand more amenable to neural\\nnetworks. This includes vectorization, no rmalization, handling missing values, and\\nfeature extraction.\\nVECTORIZATION\\nAll inputs and targets in a neural network must  be tensors of floating-point data (or, in\\nspecific cases, tensors of integers). Whatever data you need to process—sound,\\nimages, text—you must first turn  into tensors, a step called data vectorization . For\\ninstance, in the two previous text-classifica tion examples, we started from text repre-\\nsented as lists of integers (standing for sequences of words), and we used one-hot\\nencoding to turn them into a tensor of float32  data. In the examples of classifying\\ndigits and predicting house prices, the data  already came in vectorized form, so you\\nwere able to skip this step. \\nVALUE NORMALIZATION\\nIn the digit-classification example, you star ted from image data encoded as integers in\\nthe 0–255 range, encoding grayscale values. Before you fed this data into your net-\\nwork, you had to cast it to float32  and divide by 255 so you’d end up with floating-\\npoint values in the 0–1 rang e. Similarly, when predicti ng house prices, you started\\nfrom features that took a variety of ranges —some features had small floating-point val-\\nues, others had fairly large integer values. Before you fed this data into your network,\\nyou had to normalize each feature independen tly so that it had a standard deviation\\nof 1 and a mean of 0.\\n In general, it isn’t safe to feed into a neur al network data that takes relatively large val-\\nues (for example, multidigit integers, which ar e much larger than the initial values taken\\nby the weights of a network) or data that is heterogeneous (for example, data where onefeature is in the range 0–1 and another is in the range 100–200). Doing so can trigger\\nlarge gradient updates that w ill prevent the network from co nverging. To make learning\\neasier for your network, your data sh ould have the following characteristics:\\n\\uf0a1Take small values —Typically, most values sh ould be in the 0–1 range.\\n\\uf0a1Be homogenous —That is, all features should take values in roughly the same\\nrange.\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 123}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='102 CHAPTER  4Fundamentals of machine learning\\nAdditionally, the following stricter normal ization practice is common and can help,\\nalthough it isn’t always necessary (for example,  you didn’t do this in  the digit-classification\\nexample):\\n\\uf0a1Normalize each feature independ ently to have a mean of 0.\\n\\uf0a1Normalize each feature independently to have a standard deviation of 1.\\nThis is easy to do with Numpy arrays:\\nx -= x.mean(axis=0)\\nx /= x.std(axis=0)\\nHANDLING  MISSING  VALUES\\nYou may sometimes have missing values in yo ur data. For instance, in the house-price\\nexample, the first feature (the column of in dex 0 in the data) was the per capita crime\\nrate. What if this feature wasn’t available for all samples? You’d then have missing val-\\nues in the training or test data.\\n In general, with neural networks, it’s safe to input missing values as 0, with the con-\\ndition that 0 isn’t already a meaningful valu e. The network will learn from exposure to\\nthe data that the value 0 means missing data  and will start ignoring the value.\\n Note that if you’re expecting missing values in the test data, but the network was\\ntrained on data without any missing values, the network won’t have learned to ignore\\nmissing values! In this situation, you should  artificially generate  training samples with\\nmissing entries: copy some training samples several ti mes, and drop some of the fea-\\ntures that you expect are likely to be missing in the test data. \\n4.3.2 Feature engineering\\nFeature engineering  is the process of using your own knowledge about the data and about\\nthe machine-learning algorithm at hand (in this case, a neural network) to make the\\nalgorithm work better by applying\\nhardcoded (nonlearned) transfor-mations to the data before it goesinto the model. In many cases, it isn’t\\nreasonable to expect a machine-\\nlearning model to be able to learn\\nfrom completely arbitrary data. The\\ndata needs to be presented to the\\nmodel in a way that will make themodel’s job easier.\\n Let’s look at an intuitive example.\\nSuppose you’re trying to develop amodel that can take as input an\\nimage of a clock and can output the\\ntime of day (see figure 4.3).Assuming x is a 2D data matrix \\nof shape (samples, features) \\nRaw data:\\npixel grid\\nBetter\\nfeatures:\\nclock hands’\\ncoordinates{x1: 0.7,\\ny1: 0.7}\\n{x2: 0.5,\\ny2: 0.0}{x1: 0.0,\\ny2: 1.0}\\n{x2: -0.38,\\n2: 0.32}\\nEven better\\nfeatures:\\nangles of\\nclock handstheta1: 45\\ntheta2: 0theta1: 90\\ntheta2: 140\\nFigure 4.3 Feature engineering for reading the time on \\na clock\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 124}),\n",

You’ll need a convolutional neural net-\\nwork to solve it, and you’ll have to expend  quite a bit of com putational resources to\\ntrain the network.\\n But if you already understa nd the problem at a high level (you understand how\\nhumans read time on a clock face), then you can come up with much better input fea-\\ntures for a machine-learning algorithm: for instance, it’s easy to write a five-line\\nPython script to follow the black pixels of  the clock hands and ou tput the (x, y) coor-\\ndinates of the tip of each hand. Then a si mple machine-learning  algorithm can learn\\nto associate these coordinates with the appropriate time of day.\\n You can go even further: do a coordina te change, and express the (x, y) coordi-\\nnates as polar coordinates with regard to the center of the image.

Ov erfitting happens in every\\nmachine-learning problem. Learning how to de al with overfitting is essential to mas-\\ntering machine learning.\\n The fundamental issue in machine learni ng is the tension between optimization\\nand generalization. Optimization  refers to the process of adjusting a model to get the\\nbest performance possible on the training data (the learning  in machine learning ),\\nwhereas generalization  refers to how well the trained model performs on data it has\\nnever seen before. The goal of the game is to get good generalization, of course, but\\nyou don’t control generalization; you can on ly adjust the model based on its training\\ndata.\\n At the beginning of training, optimizati on and generalization are correlated: the\\nlower the loss on training data , the lower the loss on test data. While this is happening,\\nyour model is said to be underfit : there is still progress to be made; the network hasn’t\\nyet modeled all relevant patterns in the tr aining data. But after a certain number of\\niterations on the training data, generalizati on stops improving, and validation metrics\\nstall and then begin to degrade: the model is starting to overfit. That is, it’s beginning\\nto learn patterns that are specific to the trai ning data but that are misleading or irrele-\\nvant when it comes to new data.\\n To prevent a model from le arning misleading or irrelevant patterns found in the\\ntraining data, the best solution is to get more training data . A model trained on more data\\nwill naturally generalize better. When that isn’t possible, the next-best solution is to\\nmodulate the quantity of information that yo ur model is allowed to store or to add\\nconstraints on what information it’s allowed to store. If a network can only afford to\\nmemorize a small number of patterns, the opti mization process will force it to focus\\non the most prominent patterns, which have  a better chance of generalizing well.\\n The processing of fighting ov erfitting this way is called regularization . Let’s review\\nsome of the most common regularization techniques and apply them in practice to\\nimprove the movie-classificati on model from section 3.4.\\n4.4.1 Reducing the network’s size\\nThe simplest way to prevent overfitting is to  reduce the size of the model: the number\\nof learnable parameters in the model (which  is determined by the number of layers\\nand the number of units per layer). In deep  learning, the number of learnable param-\\neters in a model is often referred to as the model’s capacity . Intuitively, a model with\\nmore parameters has more memorization capacity  and therefore can easily learn a per-\\nfect dictionary-like mapping between trai ning samples and their targets—a mapping\\nwithout any generalization power. For instan ce, a model with 500,000 binary parame-\\nters could easily be made to lear n the class of every digit in the MNIST  training set:\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 126}),\n",

But such a model\\nwould be useless for cl assifying new digit sa mples. Always keep this in mind: deep-\\nlearning models tend to be good at fitting to the training data, but the real challenge\\nis generalization, not fitting.\\n On the other hand, if the network has li mited memorization re sources, it won’t be\\nable to learn this mapping as easily; thus, in  order to minimize it s loss, it will have to\\nresort to learning compressed representati ons that have predictive power regarding\\nthe targets—precisely the type of represen tations we’re interested in. At the same\\ntime, keep in mind that you should use models that have enough parameters that they\\ndon’t underfit: your model shouldn’t be st arved for memorization  resources.

This idea also ap plies to the models le arned by neural net-\\nworks: given some training data and a netw ork architecture, multiple sets of weight\\nvalues (multiple models ) could explain the data. Simpler models are less likely to over-\\nfit than complex ones.\\n A simple model  in this context is a model where the distribution of parameter values\\nhas less entropy (or a model with fewer para meters, as you saw in the previous sec-\\ntion). Thus a common way to mitigate overfi tting is to put constraints on the complex-\\nity of a network by forcing its weights to take only small values, which makes the\\ndistribution of weight values more regular . This is called weight regularization , and it’s\\ndone by adding to the loss function of the network a cost associated with having large\\nweights. This cost comes in two flavors:\\n\\uf0a1L1 regularization —The cost added is proportional to the absolute value of the\\nweight coefficients  (the L1 norm  of the weights).\\n\\uf0a1L2 regularization —The cost added is proportional to the square of the value of the\\nweight coefficients  (the L2 norm  of the weights). L2 regularization is also called\\nweight decay  in the context of neural networks . Don’t let the different name con-\\nfuse you: weight decay is mathematically the same as L2 regularization.\\nFigure 4.6 Effect of model \\ncapacity on training loss: trying a bigger model\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 129}),\n",

Dropout, applied to a layer, consists of randomly dropping out\\n(setting to zero) a number of output featur es of the layer during training. Let’s say a\\ngiven layer would normally return a vector [0 .2, 0.5, 1.3, 0.8, 1.1] for a given input\\nsample during training. After ap plying dropout, this vector will have a few zero entries\\ndistributed at random: for example, [0, 0.5, 1.3, 0, 1.1]. The dropout rate  is the fraction\\nof the features that are zeroed  out; it’s usually set between 0.2 and 0.5. At test time, no\\nunits are dropped out; instead, the layer’s output values are scaled down by a factor\\nequal to the dropout rate, to balance for th e fact that more units are active than at\\ntraining time.\\n Consider a Numpy matrix contai ning the output of a layer, \\nlayer_output , of\\nshape (batch_size, features) . At training time, we zero out at random a fraction of\\nthe values in the matrix:\\nlayer_output *= np.random.randint(0, high=2, size=layer_output.shape)\\nAt test time, we scale down the output by the dropout rate. Here, we scale by 0.5\\n(because we previously dropped half the units):\\nlayer_output *= 0.5\\nNote that this process can be implemented by doing both operations at training time\\nand leaving the output unchanged at test time, which is often the way it’s imple-\\nmented in practice (see figure 4.8):\\nlayer_output *= np.random.randint(0, high=2, size=layer_output.shape)\\nlayer_output /= 0.5\\nThis technique may seem strange and arbitr ary. Why would this help reduce overfit-\\nting? Hinton says he was inspired by, am ong other things, a fr aud-prevention mecha-\\nnism used by banks. In his own words, “I went to my bank. The tellers kept changing\\nand I asked one of them why.

The bluepr int ties together the concepts you’ve\\nlearned about in this chapter: problem de finition, evaluation, feature engineering,\\nand fighting overfitting.\\n4.5.1 Defining the problem and assembling a dataset\\nFirst, you must define  the problem at hand:\\n\\uf0a1What will your input data be? What are yo u trying to predict? You can only learn\\nto predict something if you have availa ble training data: for example, you can\\nonly learn to classify the sentiment of  movie reviews if you have both movie\\nreviews and sentiment annotations available.  As such, data availability is usually\\nthe limiting factor at this stage (unless you have the means to pay people to col-\\nlect data for you).\\n\\uf0a1What type of problem are you facing? Is it  binary classification? Multiclass classi-\\nfication? Scalar regression? Vector regression? Multicla ss, multilabel classifica-\\ntion? Something else, like clustering, ge neration, or reinforcement learning?\\nIdentifying the problem type will guide yo ur choice of model architecture, loss\\nfunction, and so on.\\nYou can’t move to the next stage until you know what your inputs and outputs are, and\\nwhat data you’ll use. Be aware of th e hypotheses you make at this stage:\\n\\uf0a1You hypothesize that your outputs can be predicted given your inputs.\\n\\uf0a1You hypothesize that your available data is sufficiently informative to learn the\\nrelationship between inputs and outputs.\\nUntil you have a working model, these are merely hypotheses, waiting to be validated\\nor invalidated. Not all problems can be solv ed; just because you’ve assembled exam-\\nples of inputs X and targets Y doesn’t mean X contai ns enough information to predict\\nY. For instance, if you’re trying to predic t the movements of a stock on the stock mar-\\nket given its recent price hi story, you’re unlikely to succeed, because price history\\ndoesn’t contain much pr edictive information.\\n One class of unsolvable problems you should be aware of is nonstationary problems .\\nSuppose you’re trying to build a recommend ation engine for clothing, you’re training\\nit on one month of data (August), and yo u want to start gene rating recommendations\\nin the winter. One big issue is  that the kinds of clothes people buy change from season\\nto season: clothes buying is a nonstation ary phenomenon over the scale of a few\\nmonths.

That often isn’t the case. \\n4.5.2 Choosing a measure of success\\nTo control something, you need  to be able to observe it. To achieve success, you must\\ndefine what you mean by success—accuracy ? Precision and recall? Customer-retention\\nrate? Your metric for success will guide the choice of a loss functi on: what your model\\nwill optimize. It should direct ly align with your higher-level  goals, such as the success\\nof your business.\\n For balanced-classification pr oblems, where every class is equally likely, accuracy and\\narea under the receiver operating characteristic curve  (ROC AUC) are common metrics. For\\nclass-imbalanced problems, you can use pr ecision and recall. For ranking problems or\\nmultilabel classification, you can use mean  average precision. And it isn’t uncommon\\nto have to define your own custom metric by which to measure success. To get a sense\\nof the diversity of machine-learning success metrics and how they relate to different\\nproblem domains, it’s helpfu l to browse the data scie nce competitions on Kaggle\\n(https:/ /kaggle.com ); they showcase a wide range of  problems and eval uation metrics. \\n4.5.3 Deciding on an evaluation protocol\\nOnce you know what you’re aiming for, you must establish ho w you’ll measure your\\ncurrent progress. We’ve previously revi ewed three common evaluation protocols:\\n\\uf0a1Maintaining a hold-out validation set —The way to go when you have plenty of\\ndata\\n\\uf0a1Doing K-fold cross-validation —The right choice when you have too few samples\\nfor hold-out validation to be reliable\\n\\uf0a1Doing iterated K-fold validation —For performing highly accurate model evalua-\\ntion when little data is available\\nJust pick one of these. In most case s, the first will work well enough. \\n4.5.4 Preparing your data\\nOnce you know what you’re training on, what  you’re optimizing for, and how to evalu-\\nate your approach, you’re almost ready to begin training models.

For\\ninstance, the IMDB  example used binary_crossentropy , the regression exam-\\nple used mse, and so on.\\n\\uf0a1Optimization configuration —What optimizer will you use? What will its learning\\nrate be? In most cases, it’s safe to go with rmsprop  and its default learning rate.\\nRegarding the choice of a loss function, note  that it isn’t always possible to directly\\noptimize for the metric that measures su ccess on a problem. Sometimes there is no\\neasy way to turn a metric into a loss function ; loss functions, after all, need to be com-\\nputable given only a mini-batch of data (i deally, a loss function should be computable\\nfor as little as a single data point) and must  be differentiable (otherwise, you can’t use\\nbackpropagation to train your  network).

But first, let’s take a pr actical look at a simple conv-\\nnet example. It uses a convnet to classify MNIST  digits, a task we performed in chapter\\n2 using a densely connected ne twork (our test accuracy then was 97.8%). Even though\\nthe convnet will be basic, its accuracy will  blow out of the water that of the densely\\nconnected model from chapter 2.\\n The following lines of code show you what  a basic convnet looks like. It’s a stack of\\nConv2D  and MaxPooling2D  layers. You’ll see in a minute exactly what they do.\\nfrom keras import layers\\nfrom keras import models\\nmodel = models.Sequential()\\nmodel.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))\\nmodel.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))\\nmodel.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))\\nImportantly, a convnet takes as input tensors of shape (image_height, image_width,\\nimage_channels)  (not including the batch dimension). In this case, we’ll configure\\nthe convnet to process inputs of size (28, 28, 1) , which is the format of MNIST\\nimages. We’ll do this by passing the argument input_shape=(28, 28, 1)  to the first\\nlayer.\\n Let’s display the architecture of the convnet so far:\\n>>> model.summary()\\n________________________________________________________________\\nLayer (type) Output Shape Param #\\n================================================================\\nconv2d_1 (Conv2D) (None, 26, 26, 32) 320________________________________________________________________\\nmaxpooling2d_1 (MaxPooling2D) (None, 13, 13, 32) 0\\n________________________________________________________________conv2d_2 (Conv2D) (None, 11, 11, 64) 18496\\n________________________________________________________________\\nmaxpooling2d_2 (MaxPooling2D) (None, 5, 5, 64) 0________________________________________________________________\\nconv2d_3 (Conv2D) (None, 3, 3, 64) 36928\\n================================================================Total params: 55,744\\nTrainable params: 55,744\\nNon-trainable params: 0\\nYou can see that the output of every Conv2D  and MaxPooling2D  layer is a 3D tensor of\\nshape (height, width, channels) .

Not bad!\\n But why does this simple convnet work so well, compared to a densely connected\\nmodel? To answer this, let’s dive into what the \\nConv2D  and MaxPooling2D  layers do.\\n5.1.1 The convolution operation\\nThe fundamental difference between a dens ely connected layer and a convolution\\nlayer is this: Dense  layers learn global patterns in their input feature space (for exam-\\nple, for a MNIST  digit, patterns involving all pixels), whereas convolution layers learn\\nlocal patterns (see figure 5.1): in the case of images, patterns found in small 2D win-\\ndows of the inputs. In the previous example, these windows were all 3 × 3.\\nFigure 5.1 Images can be broken \\ninto local patterns such as edges, \\ntextures, and so on.\\nLicensed to   <null>\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 144}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='123 Introduction to convnets\\nThis key characteristic gives convnets two interesting properties:\\n\\uf0a1The patterns they learn are translation invariant.  After learning a certain pattern in\\nthe lower-right corner of a picture, a convnet can recognize it anywhere: for\\nexample, in the upper-left corner. A densely connected network would have to\\nlearn the pattern anew if it appeared at a new location. This makes convnets\\ndata efficient when processing images (because the visual world is fundamentally\\ntranslation invariant ): they need fewer training sa mples to learn representations\\nthat have generalization power.\\n\\uf0a1They can learn spatial hierarchies of patterns (see figure 5.2) . A first convolution layer\\nwill learn small local patterns such as  edges, a second convolution layer will\\nlearn larger patterns made of the features of the first layers, and so on. Thisallows convnets to efficiently learn incr easingly complex and abstract visual con-\\ncepts (because the visual world is fundamentally spatially hierarchical ).\\nConvolutions operate over \\n3D tensors, called feature maps , with two spatial axes ( height\\nand width ) as well as a depth  axis (also called the channels  axis). For an RGB image, the\\ndimension of the depth axis is 3, becaus e the image has three color channels: red,\\ngreen, and blue. For a black- and-white picture, like the MNIST  digits, the depth is 1\\n(levels of gray). The convolution operatio n extracts patches from its input feature\\nmap and applies the same transformation to all of these patches, producing an output\\nfeature map . This output feature map is still a 3D tensor: it has a width and a height. Its\\ndepth can be arbitrary, because the output depth is a parameter of the layer, and the“cat”\\nFigure 5.2 The visual world forms a spatial hierarchy of visual \\nmodules: hyperlocal edges combine into local objects such as eyes or ears, which combine into high-level concepts such as “cat.”\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 145}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='124 CHAPTER  5Deep learning for computer vision\\ndifferent channels in that depth axis no longer stand for specific colors as in RGB\\ninput; rather, they stand for filters . Filters encode specific aspe cts of the input data: at a\\nhigh level, a single filter could encode th e concept “presence of a face in the input,”\\nfor instance.\\n In the MNIST  example, the first convolution layer takes a feature map of size (28,\\n28, 1)  and outputs a feature map of size (26,  26, 32): it computes 32 filters over its\\ninput. Each of these 32 output channels cont ains a 26 × 26 grid of values, which is a\\nresponse map  of the filter over the input, indicating  the response of that filter pattern at\\ndifferent locations in the input (see figure 5.3). That is what the term feature map\\nmeans: every dimension in the depth axis is a feature (or filter), and the 2D tensor\\noutput[:, :, n]  is the 2D spatial map of the response of this filter over the input.\\nConvolutions are defined by two key parameters:\\n\\uf0a1Size of the patches extracted from the inputs —These are typically 3 × 3 or 5 × 5. In the\\nexample, they were 3 × 3, which is a common choice.\\n\\uf0a1Depth of the output feature map —The number of filters computed by the convolu-\\ntion. The example started with a depth of 32 and ended with a depth of 64.\\nIn Keras Conv2D  layers, these parameters are the first arguments passed to the layer:\\nConv2D(output_depth, (window_height, window_width)) .\\n A convolution works by sliding  these windows of size 3 × 3 or 5 × 5 over the 3D input\\nfeature map, stopping at every po ssible location, and extracting the 3D patch of sur-\\nrounding features (shape (window_height,  window_width,  input_depth) ). Each\\nsuch 3D patch is then transformed (via a tensor product with the same learned weight\\nmatrix, called the convolution kernel ) into a 1D vector of shape (output_depth,) . All of\\nthese vectors are then spatially reassembled into a 3D output map of shape (height,\\nwidth, output_depth) . Every spatial location in the output feature map corresponds\\nto the same location in the input feature map (for example, the lower-right corner of\\nthe output contains information about th e lower-right corner of the input). For\\ninstance, with 3 × 3 windows, the vector output[i,  j, :] comes from the 3D patch\\ninput[i-1:i+1,  j-1:j+1,  :].

There are only 9 tiles around which you\\ncan center a 3 × 3 window, forming a 3 × 3 grid (see figure 5.5). Hence, the output fea-\\nture map will be 3 × 3. It shrinks a little: by exactly two tiles alongside each dimension,\\nin this case.

Padding consists of adding an appropriate number of rows\\nand columns on each side of the input featur e map so as to make it possible to fit cen-\\nter convolution window s around every input tile. For a 3 × 3 window, you add one col-\\numn on the right, one column on the left,  one row at the top, and one row at the\\nbottom. For a 5 × 5 window, you add two rows (see figure 5.6).\\nIn Conv2D  layers, padding is configurable via the padding  argument, which takes two\\nvalues: \"valid\" , which means no padding (only valid window locations will be used);\\nand \"same\" , which means “pad in such a way as to  have an output with the same width\\nand height as the input.” The padding  argument defaults to \"valid\" . \\n Figure 5.5 Valid locations of 3 × 3 patches in a 5 × 5 input feature map\\netc.\\nFigure 5.6 Padding a 5 × 5 input in order to be able to extract 25 3 × 3 patches\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 148}),\n",

The description\\nof convolution so far has assumed that the center tiles of the co nvolution windows are\\nall contiguous. But the distance between two successive windows is  a parameter of the\\nconvolution, called its stride , which defaults to 1. It’s possible to have strided convolu-\\ntions : convolutions with a stride higher than 1. In figure 5.7, you can see the patches\\nextracted by a 3 × 3 convolution with stride  2 over a 5 × 5 input (without padding).\\nUsing stride 2 means the width and height of the feature map are downsampled by a\\nfactor of 2 (in addition to any changes in duced by border effects). Strided convolu-\\ntions are rarely used in practice, although  they can come in handy for some types of\\nmodels; it’s good to be familiar with the concept.\\n To downsample feature maps, instea d of strides, we tend to use the max-pooling\\noperation, which you saw in action in the first convnet example. Let’s look at it in\\nmore depth. \\n5.1.2 The max-pooling operation\\nIn the convnet example, you may have noticed that the size of the feature maps ishalved after every \\nMaxPooling2D  layer. For instance, before the first MaxPooling2D  lay-\\ners, the feature map is 26 × 26, but the max-pooling operation halves it to 13 × 13.\\nThat’s the role of max pooling: to aggre ssively downsample fe ature maps, much like\\nstrided convolutions.\\n Max pooling consists of extracting wind ows from the input feature maps and out-\\nputting the max value of each channel. It’s conceptually similar to  convolution, except\\nthat instead of transforming local patches vi a a learned linear tran sformation (the con-\\nvolution kernel), they’re transformed via a hardcoded max tensor operation.

On the other hand,\\nconvolution is typically done with 3 × 3 windows and no stride (stride 1).\\n Why downsample feature maps this way?  Why not remove the max-pooling layers\\nand keep fairly large feature maps all the wa y up? Let’s look at this option. The convo-\\nlutional base of the model would then look like this:\\nmodel_no_max_pool = models.Sequential()\\nmodel_no_max_pool.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu',\\ninput_shape=(28, 28, 1)))\\nmodel_no_max_pool.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))\\nmodel_no_max_pool.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))\\nHere’s a summary of the model:\\n>>> model_no_max_pool.summary()\\nLayer (type) Output Shape Param #\\n================================================================\\nconv2d_4 (Conv2D) (None, 26, 26, 32) 320________________________________________________________________conv2d_5 (Conv2D) (None, 24, 24, 64) 18496\\n________________________________________________________________\\nconv2d_6 (Conv2D) (None, 22, 22, 64) 36928================================================================\\nTotal params: 55,744\\nTrainable params: 55,744Non-trainable params: 0\\nWhat’s wrong with this setup? Two things:\\n\\uf0a1It isn’t conducive to learning a spatial hierarchy of features . The 3 × 3 windows\\nin the third layer will only contain information coming from 7 × 7 windows in\\nthe initial input. The high-level patterns learned by the convnet will still be very\\nsmall with regard to the initial input, wh ich may not be enough to learn to clas-\\nsify digits (try recognizing a digit by on ly looking at it through windows that are\\n7 × 7 pixels!). We need the features from the last convolution layer to containinformation about the totality of the input.\\n\\uf0a1The final feature map has 22 × 22 × 64 = 30,976 total coefficients per sample.This is huge. If you were to flatten it to stick a \\nDense  layer of size 512 on top,\\nthat layer would have 15.8 million parameters. This is far too large for such a\\nsmall model and would result in intense overfitting.\\nIn short, the reason to use downsampling is to reduce the number of feature-map\\ncoefficients to process, as well as to induce  spatial-filter hierarch ies by making succes-\\nsive convolution layers look at increasingly  large windows (in terms of the fraction of\\nthe original input they cover).\\n Note that max pooling isn’t the only way you can achieve such downsampling.

But max pooling tends to work better than these alternative solutions. In a nut-\\nshell, the reason is that features tend to  encode the spatial presence of some pattern\\nor concept over the different tiles of the feature map (hence, the term feature map ),\\nand it’s more informative to look at the maximal presence  of different features than at\\ntheir average presence . So the most reasonable subsampling strategy is to first produce\\ndense maps of features (via unstrided co nvolutions) and then look at the maximal\\nactivation of the features over small patches,  rather than looking at sparser windows of\\nthe inputs (via strided convolutions) or av eraging input patches, which could cause\\nyou to miss or dilute feature-presence information.\\n At this point, you should understand the basics of convnets—feature maps, convo-\\nlution, and max pooling—and you know how to build a small convnet to solve a toyproblem such as \\nMNIST  digits classification.

A “few” samples can mean anywhere from a few hundred to a\\nfew tens of thousands of images. As a prac tical example, we’ll focus on classifying\\nimages as dogs or cats, in a dataset contai ning 4,000 pictures of cats and dogs (2,000\\ncats, 2,000 dogs). We’ll use 2,000 pictures for training—1,000 for validation, and\\n1,000 for testing.\\n In this section, we’ll review one basic strategy to tackle this problem: training a new\\nmodel from scratch using what little data yo u have. You’ll start by naively training a\\nsmall convnet on the 2,000 trai ning samples, without any re gularization, to set a base-\\nline for what can be achieved. This will ge t you to a classification accuracy of 71%. At\\nthat point, the main issue will be overfitting. Then we’ll introduce data augmentation , a\\npowerful technique for mitigating overfitting in computer vision. By using data aug-\\nmentation, you’ll improve the networ k to reach an accuracy of 82%.\\n In the next section, we’ ll review two more essential techniques for applying deep\\nlearning to small datasets: feature extraction with a pretrained network  (which will get you\\nto an accuracy of 90% to 96%) and fine-tuning a pretrained network  (this will get you to a\\nfinal accuracy of 97%). To gether, these three strategi es—training a small model from\\nscratch, doing feature extraction using a pretrained model, and fine-tuning a pre-\\ntrained model—will constitute your future  toolbox for tackling the problem of per-\\nforming image classification with small datasets.\\n5.2.1 The relevance of deep le arning for small-data problems\\nYou’ll sometimes hear th at deep learning only works when lots of data is available.\\nThis is valid in part: one fundamental characte ristic of deep learning is that it can find\\ninteresting features in the training data on  its own, without any need for manual fea-\\nture engineering, and this can only be achi eved when lots of training examples are\\navailable. This is especially true for pr oblems where the input samples are very high-\\ndimensional, like images.\\n But what constitutes lots of samples is relative—relative to the size and depth of the\\nnetwork you’re trying to train, for starters. It isn’t possible to train a convnet to solve a\\ncomplex problem with just a few tens of samples, bu t a few hundred can potentially\\nsuffice if the model is small and well regularized and the task is simple. Because conv-\\nnets learn local, translation-invariant featur es, they’re highly data efficient on percep-\\ntual problems. Training a convnet from scratc h on a very small image dataset will still\\nyield reasonable results despite a relative lack of data, without the need for any customfeature engineering. You’ll see th is in action in this section.\\n What’s more, deep-learning models are by nature highly repurposable: you can\\ntake, say, an image-classification or speech- to-text model trained on a large-scale dataset\\nand reuse it on a significantly different problem with only minor changes.

Here, because you start from inputs of size 150 × 150 (a somewhat arbitrary\\nchoice), you end up with feature maps of size 7 × 7 just before the Flatten  layer.Copies the first \\n1,000 dog images \\nto train_dogs_dir\\nCopies the next 500 \\ndog images to \\nvalidation_dogs_dir\\nCopies the next 500 \\ndog images to test_dogs_dir\\nLicensed to   <null>\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 155}),\n",

A pretrained network  is a saved network that was previously\\ntrained on a large dataset, typically on a la rge-scale image-classifi cation task. If this\\noriginal dataset is large enough and general enough, then the spatial hierarchy of fea-\\ntures learned by the pretrained network can effectively act as a generic model of the\\nvisual world, and hence its features can prove useful for many different computer-\\nvision problems, even though these new problems may involve completely different\\nclasses than those of the original task. For instance, you might train a network on\\nImageNet (where classes are mostly animal s and everyday objects) and then repur-\\npose this trained network for something as  remote as identifying furniture items in\\nimages. Such portability of learned features across differ ent problems is a key advan-\\ntage of deep learning compared to many older, shallow-learning approaches, and it\\nmakes deep learning very effe ctive for small-data problems.\\n In this case, let’s consider a large convnet trained on the ImageNet dataset\\n(1.4 million labeled images and 1,000 differe nt classes). ImageNet contains many ani-\\nmal classes, including different species of cats and dogs, and you can thus expect to\\nperform well on the dogs-versu s-cats classification problem.\\n You’ll use the VGG16  architecture, developed by Karen Simonyan and Andrew\\nZisserman in 2014; it’s a si mple and widely used convne t architecture for ImageNet.1\\nAlthough it’s an older model, far from the current state of the art and somewhat\\nheavier than many other recent models, I chos e it because its architecture is similar to\\nwhat you’re already familiar with and is easy to understand without introducing any\\nnew concepts. This may be your first encounter with one of these cutesy modelnames—\\nVGG, ResNet, Inception, Ince ption-ResNet, Xception, and so on; you’ll get\\nused to them, because they will come up fr equently if you keep doing deep learning\\nfor computer vision.\\n There are two ways to us e a pretrained network: feature extraction  and fine-tuning .\\nWe’ll cover both of them. Let’s start with feature extraction.\\n5.3.1 Feature extraction\\nFeature extraction consists of using the re presentations learned by a previous network\\nto extract interesting features from new sa mples. These features are then run through\\na new classifier, which is trained from scratch.\\n As you saw previously, convnets used fo r image classification  comprise two parts:\\nthey start with a series of pooling and conv olution layers, and they end with a densely\\nconnected classifier. The fi rst part is called the convolutional base  of the model. In the\\ncase of convnets, feature extraction consists of taking the convolutional base of a\\n1Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman, “Very Deep Co nvolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recog-\\nnition,” arXiv (2014), https:/ /arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556 .\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 165}),\n",

Coul d you reuse the densely connected classi-\\nfier as well? In general, doing so should be avoided. The reason is that the representa-tions learned by the convolutional base are likely to be more generic and therefore\\nmore reusable: the feature maps of a convnet are presence maps of generic concepts\\nover a picture, which is likely to be usef ul regardless of the computer-vision problem at\\nhand. But the representations learned by the cla ssifier will necessarily be specific to the\\nset of classes on which the model was traine d—they will only contain information about\\nthe presence probability of this or that cla ss in the entire picture. Additionally, repre-\\nsentations found in densely connected layers  no longer contain any information about\\nwhere  objects are located in the input image: th ese layers get rid of the notion of space,\\nwhereas the object location is  still described by convolut ional feature maps. For prob-\\nlems where object location matters, densel y connected features are largely useless.\\n Note that the level of generality (and th erefore reusability) of the representations\\nextracted by specific convolution layers depends on the depth of the layer in the\\nmodel. Layers that come earlier in the mo del extract local, highly generic feature\\nmaps (such as visual edges, colors, and te xtures), whereas layers that are higher up\\nextract more-abstract concepts (such as “cat ear” or “dog eye”).

The model may still be improving even if this isn’t reflected\\nin the average loss.\\n You can now finally evaluate this model on the test data:\\ntest_generator = test_datagen.flow_from_directory(\\ntest_dir,\\ntarget_size=(150, 150),batch_size=20,\\nclass_mode='binary')\\ntest_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate_generator(test_generator, steps=50)\\nprint('test acc:', test_acc)\\nHere you get a test accuracy of 97%. In th e original Kaggle competition around this\\ndataset, this would have been one of the top results. But using modern deep-learning\\ntechniques, you managed to reach this result using only  a small fraction of the train-\\ning data available (about 10%). There is a huge difference between being able to train\\non 20,000 samples compared to 2,000 samples!\\n \\nFigure 5.23 Smoothed curves for training and validation loss for fine-tuning\\nLicensed to   <null>\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 180}),\n",

Although this is\\npartially true for certain types of deep-lea rning models, it’s defi nitely not true for\\nconvnets. The representations learned by co nvnets are highly amenable to visualiza-\\ntion, in large part because they’re representations of visual concepts . Since 2013, a wide\\narray of techniques have b een developed for visualizing and interpreting these repre-\\nsentations. We won’t survey all of them, bu t we’ll cover three of the most accessible\\nand useful ones:\\n\\uf0a1Visualizing intermediate convnet outputs (intermediate activations) —Useful for\\nunderstanding how successive convnet la yers transform their input, and for get-\\nting a first idea of the meanin g of individual convnet filters.\\n\\uf0a1Visualizing convnets filters —Useful for understanding precisely what visual pat-\\ntern or concept each filter in a convnet is receptive to.\\n\\uf0a1Visualizing heatmaps of class activation in an image —Useful for understanding\\nwhich parts of an image were identified as  belonging to a given class, thus allow-\\ning you to localize objects in images.\\nFor the first method—activation visualizat ion—you’ll use the small convnet that you\\ntrained from scratch on the dogs-versus-cats classification problem in section 5.2. For\\nthe next two methods, you’ll use the VGG16  model introduced in section 5.3.\\n5.4.1 Visualizing intermediate activations\\nVisualizing intermediate activations consists  of displaying the feature maps that are\\noutput by various convolution and pooling la yers in a network, given a certain input\\n(the output of a layer is often called its activation , the output of the activation func-\\ntion). This gives a view into how an inpu t is decomposed into the different filters\\nlearned by the network. You want to visualize feature maps with three dimensions:\\nwidth, height, and depth (channels). Each  channel encodes relatively independent\\nfeatures, so the proper way to visualize these feature maps is by independently plot-ting the contents of every channel as a \\n2D image.

At that stage, the\\nactivations retain almost all of the information present in the initial picture.\\n\\uf0a1As you go higher, the activations become  increasingly abstra ct and less visually\\ninterpretable. They begin to encode higher -level concepts such as “cat ear” and\\n“cat eye.” Higher presentations carry increasingly less information about the\\nvisual contents of the image, and increa singly more information related to the\\nclass of the image.\\n\\uf0a1The sparsity of the activations increases wi th the depth of the layer: in the first\\nlayer, all filters are activated by the in put image; but in the following layers,\\nmore and more filters are blank. This means the pattern encoded by the filter\\nisn’t found in the input image.\\nWe have just evidenced an important univer sal characteristic of the representations\\nlearned by deep neural networks: the feat ures extracted by a layer become increas-\\ningly abstract with the depth of the layer. The activations of higher layers carry less\\nand less information about the specific in put being seen, and more and more infor-\\nmation about the target (in this case, the cl ass of the image: cat or dog). A deep neu-\\nral network effectively acts as an information distillation pipeline , with raw data going in\\n(in this case, RGB pictures) and being repeat edly transformed so th at irrelevant infor-\\nmation is filtered out (for example, the sp ecific visual appearance of the image), and\\nuseful information is magnified and refine d (for example, the class of the image).\\n This is analogous to the way humans an d animals perceive the world: after observ-\\ning a scene for a few seconds, a human ca n remember which abstract objects were\\npresent in it (bicycle, tree) but can’t re member the specific appearance of these\\nobjects.

This can be done with gradient ascent in\\ninput space : applying gradient descent  to the value of the input image of a convnet so as\\nto maximize  the response of a specif ic filter, starting from a blank input image. The\\nresulting input image will be one that the chosen filter is maximally responsive to.\\n The process is simple: you’ ll build a loss function that  maximizes the value of a\\ngiven filter in a given convolution layer,  and then you’ll use stochastic gradient\\ndescent to adjust the values of the input imag e so as to maximize this activation value.\\nFor instance, here’s a loss for the activation of filter 0 in the layer block3_conv1  of the\\nVGG16 network, pretrained on ImageNet.\\nfrom keras.applications import VGG16\\nfrom keras import backend as K\\nmodel = VGG16(weights='imagenet',\\ninclude_top=False)\\nlayer_name = 'block3_conv1'\\nfilter_index = 0\\nlayer_output = model.get_layer(layer_name).output\\nloss = K.mean(layer_output[:, :, :, filter_index])\\nTo implement gradient descent, you’ll need  the gradient of this loss with respect to\\nthe model’s input.

              " Document(page_content='180 CHAPTER  6Deep learning for text and sequences\\n6.1 Working with text data\\nText is one of the most widespread forms of sequence data. It can be understood as\\neither a sequence of characte rs or a sequence of words, but it’s most common to work\\nat the level of words. The deep-learning sequence-processing mo dels introduced in\\nthe following sections can use text to produce a basic form of natural-language under-\\nstanding, sufficient for applications incl uding document classi fication, sentiment\\nanalysis, author identification, and even question-answering ( QA) (in a constrained\\ncontext). Of course, keep in mind throughout this chapter that none of these deep-\\nlearning models truly understand text in  a human sense; rather, these models can\\nmap the statistical structure of written lang uage, which is sufficient to solve many sim-\\nple textual tasks. Deep learning for natural- language processing is  pattern recognition\\napplied to words, sentences, and paragrap hs, in much the same way that computer\\nvision is pattern recognition applied to pixels.\\n Like all other neural netw orks, deep-learning models don’t take as input raw text:\\nthey only work with numeric tensors. Vectorizing  text is the process of transforming text\\ninto numeric tensors. This can be done in multiple ways:\\n\\uf0a1Segment text into words, and transform each word into a vector.\\n\\uf0a1Segment text into characters, and tran sform each characte r into a vector.\\n\\uf0a1Extract n-grams of words or characters, an d transform each n-gram into a vector.\\nN-grams  are overlapping groups of multiple  consecutive word s or characters.\\nCollectively, the different units into which you can break down text (words, charac-\\nters, or n-grams) are called tokens , and breaking text into such tokens is called tokeniza-\\ntion. All text-vectorization proc esses consist of applying so me tokenization scheme and\\nthen associating numeric vectors with the generated tokens. These vectors, packed\\ninto sequence tensors, are fed into deep neural networks. There are multiple ways to\\nassociate a vector with a to ken. In this section, I’ ll present two major ones: one-hot\\nencoding  of tokens, and token embedding  (typically used exclusively for words, and called\\nword embedding ). The remainder of this section ex plains these techniques and shows\\nhow to use them to go from raw text to a Numpy tensor that you can send to a Kerasnetwork.\\nText\\n“The cat sat on the mat.”\\nTokens\\n“the”, “cat”, “sat”, “on”, “the”, “mat”, “.”\\nVector encoding of the tokens\\n0.0 0.0 0.4 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0\\n0.5 1.0 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.5 0.0\\n1.0 0.2 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0\\nthe cat sat on the mat .Figure 6.1 From text \\nto tokens to vectors\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 202}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='181 Working with text data\\n \\n6.1.1 One-hot encoding of words and characters\\nOne-hot encoding is the most common, most basic way to turn a token into a vector.\\nYou saw it in action in the initial IMDB  and Reuters examples in chapter 3 (done with\\nwords, in that case). It consists of asso ciating a unique integer index with every word\\nand then turning this integer index i into a binary vector of size N (the size of the\\nvocabulary); the vector is  all zeros except for the ith entry, which is 1.\\n Of course, one-hot encoding can be done at the character level, as well. To unam-\\nbiguously drive home what one-hot encoding  is and how to implement it, listings 6.1\\nand 6.2 show two toy examples: one fo r words, the other for characters.Understanding n-grams and bag-of-words\\nWord n-grams are groups of N (or fewer) consecutive words that you can extract from\\na sentence. The same concept may also be applied to characters instead of words.\\nHere’s a simple example. Consider the sentence “The cat sat on the mat.” It may be\\ndecomposed into the following set of 2-grams:\\n{\"The\", \"The cat\", \"cat\", \"cat sat\", \"sat\",\\n\"sat on\", \"on\", \"on the\", \"the\", \"the mat\", \"mat\"}\\nIt may also be decomposed into the following set of 3-grams:\\n{\"The\", \"The cat\", \"cat\", \"cat sat\", \"The cat sat\",\\n\"sat\", \"sat on\", \"on\", \"cat sat on\", \"on the\", \"the\",\\n\"sat on the\", \"the mat\", \"mat\", \"on the mat\"}\\nSuch a set is called a bag-of-2-grams  or bag-of-3-grams , respectively. The term bag\\nhere refers to the fact that you’re dealing with a set of tokens rather than a list or\\nsequence: the tokens have no specific order. This family of tokenization methods is\\ncalled bag-of-words .\\nBecause bag-of-words isn’t an order-preserving tokenization method (the tokens gen-\\nerated are understood as a set, not a sequ ence, and the general structure of the sen-\\ntences is lost), it tends to be used in shallow language-processing models rather than\\nin deep-learning models. Extracting n-grams is a form of feature engineering, and\\ndeep learning does away with this kind of ri gid, brittle approach, replacing it with hier-\\narchical feature learning. One-dimensional convnets and recurrent neural networks,\\nintroduced later in this chapter, are capable of learning representations for groups of\\nwords and characters without being explicitly  told about the existence of such groups,\\nby looking at continuous word or character sequences. For this reason, we won’t\\ncover n-grams any further in this book. But do keep in mind that they’re a powerful,\\nunavoidable feature-engineerin g tool when using lightweig ht, shallow text-processing\\nmodels such as logistic regression and random forests.\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 203}),\n",

Whereas the vectors obtained through one-hot\\nencoding are binary, sparse (mostly made of  zeros), and very hi gh-dimensional (same\\ndimensionality as the number of words in the vocabulary), word embeddings are low-\\ndimensional floating-point ve ctors (that is, dense vectors,  as opposed to sparse vec-\\ntors); see figure 6.2. Unlike the word vectors obtained via one-hot encoding, word\\nembeddings are learned from data. It’s common to see word embeddings that are\\n256-dimensional, 512-dimensio nal, or 1,024-dimensional when dealing with very large\\nvocabularies. On the other hand, one-hot en coding words generall y leads to vectors\\nthat are 20,000-dimensional or greater (capturing a vocabulary of 20,000 tokens, in\\nthis case). So, word embeddings pack more information into far fewer dimensions.\\nThere are two ways to obtain word embeddings:\\n\\uf0a1Learn word embeddings jointly with the ma in task you care about (such as doc-\\nument classification or sent iment prediction).

The problem with this approach is  that the resulting embedding space has\\nno structure: for instance, the words accurate  and exact may end up with completely\\ndifferent embeddings, even though they’re interchangeable in mo st sentences. It’s\\ndifficult for a deep neural network to ma ke sense of such a noisy, unstructured\\nembedding space.\\n To get a bit more abstract, the geomet ric relationships between word vectors\\nshould reflect the semantic relationships between these words. Word embeddings are\\nmeant to map human language into a geomet ric space. For instan ce, in a reasonable\\nembedding space, you would expect synonyms to be embedded into similar word vec-\\ntors; and in general, you would expect the geometric distance (such as L2 distance)\\nbetween any two word vectors to relate to the semantic distance between the associ-\\nated words (words meaning different things  are embedded at points far away from\\neach other, whereas related words are closer ). In addition to distance, you may want\\nspecific directions  in the embedding space to be meanin gful. To make this clearer, let’s\\nlook at a concrete example.\\n In figure 6.3, four words are embedded on a 2D plane:\\ncat, dog, wolf, and tiger. With the vector representations we\\nchose here, some semantic relationships between these\\nwords can be encoded as geometric transformations. Forinstance, the same vector allows us to go from cat to tiger\\nand from dog to wolf: this vector could be interpreted as the\\n“from pet to wild animal” vector. Similarly, another vectorlets us go from dog to cat and from wolf to tiger, which could\\nbe interpreted as a “from canine to feline” vector.\\n In real-world word-embed ding spaces, common exam-\\nples of meaningful geometri c transformations are “gender”\\nvectors and “plural” vectors. For instance, by adding a “female” vector to the vector\\n“king,” we obtain the vector “queen.” By ad ding a “plural” vector, we obtain “kings.”\\nWord-embedding spaces typically feature th ousands of such inte rpretable and poten-\\ntially useful vectors.\\n Is there some ideal word-embedding sp ace that would perf ectly map human lan-\\nguage and could be used for any natural-language-processing task? Possibly, but wehave yet to compute anything of the so rt. Also, there is no such a thing as human lan-\\nguage —there are many different languages, and they aren’t isomorphic, because a lan-\\nguage is the reflection of a specific culture and a specific  context. But more\\npragmatically, what makes a go od word-embedding space depe nds heavily on your task:\\nthe perfect word-embedding space for an English-language movie-review sentiment-\\nanalysis model may look different from th e perfect embedding space for an English-\\nlanguage legal-document-classification model, because the importance of certain\\nsemantic relationships vari es from task to task.1\\n0\\n1 0WolfTiger\\nCatDog\\nX\\nFigure 6.3 A toy example \\nof a word-embedding space\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 207}),\n",

What do\\nyou do then?\\n Instead of learning word embeddings jo intly with the problem you want to solve,\\nyou can load embedding vectors from a precomputed embedding space that youknow is highly structured and exhibits useful properties—that captures generic\\naspects of language structure. The ration ale behind using pretrained word embed-\\ndings in natural-language processing is mu ch the same as for using pretrained conv-\\nnets in image classification: you don’t ha ve enough data available to learn truly\\npowerful features on your own, but you expe ct the features that you need to be fairly\\ngeneric—that is, common visual features or semantic features. In this case, it makes\\nsense to reuse features learned on a different problem.\\n Such word embeddings are generally co mputed using word-occurrence statistics\\n(observations about what words co-occur in sentences or documents), using a variety of\\ntechniques, some involving ne ural networks, others not. The idea of a dense, low-\\ndimensional embedding space fo r words, computed in an unsupervised way, was ini-\\ntially explored by Bengio et al. in the early 2000s,\\n1 but it only started to take off in\\nresearch and industry applications after the release of one of the most famous and suc-\\ncessful word-embedding scheme s: the Word2vec algorithm ( https:/ /code.google.com/\\narchive/p/word2vec ), developed by Tomas Mikolov at Google in 2013. Word2vec\\ndimensions capture specific semantic properties, such as gender.\\n There are various precomputed databases of word embeddings that you can down-\\nload and use in a Keras Embedding  layer. Word2vec is one of them. Another popular\\none is called Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe, https:/ /nlp.stanford\\n.edu/projects/glove ), which was developed by Stanford researchers in 2014. This\\nembedding technique is based on factorizin g a matrix of word co-occurrence statis-\\ntics. Its developers have made availabl e precomputed embeddings for millions of\\nEnglish tokens, obtained from Wikipedia data and Common Crawl data.\\n Let’s look at how you can get started using GloVe embeddings in a Keras model.\\nThe same method is valid for Word2vec embeddings or any other word-embeddingdatabase. You’ll also use this example to  refresh the text-tokenization techniques\\nintroduced a few paragraphs ago: you’ll start from raw text and work your way up. \\n6.1.3 Putting it all together: fr om raw text to word embeddings\\nYou’ll use a model similar to the one we just went over: embedding sentences in\\nsequences of vectors, flatte ning them, and training a Dense  layer on top. But you’ll do\\nso using pretrained word embeddings; and instead of using the pretokenized IMDB\\ndata packaged in Keras, you’ll start from sc ratch by downloading the original text data.\\n1Yoshua Bengio et al., Neural Probabilistic Language Models  (Springer, 2003).\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 210}),\n",

Each input shown to\\nthem is processed independently, with no st ate kept in between inputs. With such net-\\nworks, in order to pr ocess a sequence or a temporal se ries of data points, you have to\\nshow the entire sequence to the network at on ce: turn it into a single data point. For\\ninstance, this is what you did in the IMDB example: an entire movie review was trans-\\nformed into a single large vector and processed in one go. Such networks are called\\nfeedforward networks .\\n In contrast, as you’re reading the presen t sentence, you’re pr ocessing it word by\\nword—or rather, eye saccade by eye saccade—while keeping memories of what came\\nbefore; this gives you a fluid representation of the meaning conveyed by this sentence.\\nBiological intelligence processes information incrementally while maintaining an\\ninternal model of what it’s processing, built from past information and constantly\\nupdated as new information comes in.\\n A recurrent neural network  (RNN ) adopts the same principle, albeit in an extremely\\nsimplified version: it proce sses sequences by iterating th rough the sequence elements\\nand maintaining a state containing information relative\\nto what it has seen so far. In effect, an RNN  is a type of\\nneural network that has an inte rnal loop (see figure 6.9).\\nThe state of the RNN  is reset between processing two dif-\\nferent, independent sequences (such as two different\\nIMDB  reviews), so you still co nsider one sequence a sin-\\ngle data point: a single input to the network. Whatchanges is that this data point is no longer processed in a\\nsingle step; rather, the ne twork internally loops over\\nsequence elements.\\n To make these notions of loop and state clear, let’s implement the forward pass of a\\ntoy \\nRNN  in Numpy. This RNN  takes as input a sequence of  vectors, which you’ll encode\\nas a 2D tensor of size (timesteps, input_features) . It loops over timesteps, and at\\neach timestep, it consid ers its current state at t and the input at t (of shape (input_\\nfeatures,) , and combines them to obtain the output at t. You’ll then set the state for\\nthe next step to be this previous output. For the first timestep, the previous output\\nisn’t defined; hence, there is no current stat e. So, you’ll initialize the state as an all-\\nzero vector called the initial state  of the network.\\n In pseudocode, this is the RNN .\\nstate_t = 0\\nfor input_t in input_sequence:\\noutput_t = f(input_t, state_t)\\nstate_t = output_tListing 6.19 Pseudocode RNN\\nThe state at t\\nIterates over sequence elements\\nThe previous output becomes th e state for the next iteration.RNN\\nInputOutput\\nRecurrent\\nconnection\\nFigure 6.9 A recurrent \\nnetwork: a network with a loop\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 218}),\n",

Let’s l ook at some more-\\nadvanced layers. \\n6.2.2 Understanding the LSTM and GRU layers\\nSimpleRNN  isn’t the only recurrent layer available in Keras. There are two others: LSTM\\nand GRU. In practice, you’ll always use one of these, because SimpleRNN  is generally too\\nsimplistic to be of real use. SimpleRNN  has a major issue: although  it should theoretically\\nbe able to retain at time t information about inputs s een many timesteps before, in\\npractice, such long-term depe ndencies are impossible to learn. This is due to the van-\\nishing gradient problem , an effect that is similar to what is observed with non-recurrent\\nnetworks (feedforward networks) that are many layers deep: as you keep adding layers\\nto a network, the network eventually becomes untrainable. The theoretical reasons for\\nthis effect were studied by Hochreiter, Sc hmidhuber, and Bengio in the early 1990s.2\\nThe LSTM  and GRU layers are designed to solve this problem.\\n Let’s consider the LSTM  layer. The underlying Lo ng Short-Term Memory ( LSTM )\\nalgorithm was developed by Hoch reiter and Schmidhuber in 1997;3 it was the culmi-\\nnation of their research on the vanishing gradient problem.\\n This layer is a variant of the SimpleRNN  layer you already know about; it adds a way\\nto carry information across many timesteps.  Imagine a conveyor belt running parallel\\nto the sequence you’re processing. Informat ion from the sequence can jump onto the\\nconveyor belt at any point, be transported to a later time step, and jump off, intact,\\nwhen you need it. This is essentially what LSTM  does: it saves information for later,\\nthus preventing older signals from gradually vanishing during processing.\\n To understand this in detail, let’s start from the SimpleRNN  cell (see figure 6.13).\\nBecause you’ll have a lot of weight matrices, index the W and U matrices in the cell with\\nthe letter o (Wo and Uo) for output .\\n2See, for example, Yoshua Bengio, Patrice Simard, and Paolo Frasconi, “Learning Long-Term Dependencies\\nwith Gradient Descent Is Difficult,” IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks  5, no. 2 (1994).\\n3Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber, “Long Short-Term Memory,” Neural Computation  9, no. 8 (1997)....output t-1 output t output t+1\\ninput t-1 input t input t+1...\\nState t State t+1output_t =\\n activation(  Wo•input_t +  Uo•state_t +  bo)\\nFigure 6.13 The starting point of an LSTM  layer: a SimpleRNN\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 224}),\n",

Conceptually, th e carry dataflow is a way to\\nmodulate the next output and the next st ate (see figure 6.14). Simple so far.\\nNow the subtlety: the way the next value of the carry dataflow is computed. It involves\\nthree distinct transf ormations. All three have the form of a \\nSimpleRNN  cell:\\ny = activation(dot(state_t, U) + dot(input_t, W) + b)\\nBut all three transformations have their ow n weight matrices, which you’ll index with\\nthe letters i, f, and k.

For instance, yo u can say that multiplying c_t and f_t is a way to deliber-\\nately forget irrelevant information in the carry dataflow. Meanwhile, i_t and k_t pro-\\nvide information about the present, updat ing the carry track with new information.\\nBut at the end of the day, these interpreta tions don’t mean much, because what these\\noperations actually  do  is  de te rm i ned  b y the  co nte nt s  of  the  we ight s  par ame t er izi ng\\nthem; and the weights are learned in an end- to-end fashion, starting over with each\\ntraining round, making it impossible to credit this or that operation with a specific\\npurpose. The specification of an RNN  cell (as just described) determines your hypoth-\\nesis space—the space in which you’ll sear ch for a good model configuration during\\ntraining—but it doesn’t determine what the cell does; that is up to the cell weights.\\nThe same cell with different weights can be doing very different things. So the combi-\\nnation of operations making up an RNN  cell is better interpreted as a set of constraints\\non your search, not as a design  in an engineering sense.\\n To a researcher, it seems that the choice of such constraints—the question of how to\\nimplement RNN  cells—is better left to optimization algorithms (like genetic algorithms\\nor reinforcement learning processes) than to human engineers.

It will serve as a sanity\\ncheck, and it will establish a baseline that you’ll have to beat in  order to demonstrate\\nthe usefulness of more-advanced machine-le arning models. Such common-sense base-\\nlines can be useful when you’re approa ching a new problem for which there is no\\nknown solution (yet). A classic example is that of unbalanced classification tasks,\\nwhere some classes are much more common th an others. If your dataset contains 90%\\ninstances of class A and 10% instances of class B, then a common-sense approach to\\nthe classification task is to  always predict “A” when pres ented with a new sample. Such\\na classifier is 90% accurate overall, and an y learning-based approach should therefore\\nbeat this 90% score in order to demonstr ate usefulness.

In 2015, Yarin Gal, as part of his PhD thesis on Bayesian deep learn-\\ning,6 determined the proper way to use drop out with a recurrent network: the same\\ndropout mask (the same pattern of dropped units) should be applied at every time-step, instead of a dropout ma sk that varies randomly fr om timestep to timestep.\\nWhat’s more, in order to regularize the re presentations formed by  the recurrent gates\\nof layers such as \\nGRU and LSTM , a temporally constant drop out mask should be applied\\nto the inner recurrent activations of the layer (a recurrent  dropout mask). Using the\\nsame dropout mask at every timestep allo ws the network to pr operly propagate its\\nlearning error through time; a temporally  random dropout mask would disrupt this\\nerror signal and be harmfu l to the learning process.\\n Yarin Gal did his research using Keras and helped build this mechanism directly\\ninto Keras recurrent layers.

A bidirec-\\ntional RNN  is a common RNN  variant that can offer grea ter performance than a regu-\\nlar RNN  on certain tasks. It’s frequently us ed in natural-language processing—you\\ncould call it the Swiss Army knife of deep  learning for natural- language processing.\\n RNN s are notably order dependent, or time dependent: they process the timesteps\\nof their input sequences in order, and sh uffling or reversing the timesteps can com-\\npletely change the representations the RNN  extracts from the sequence. This is pre-\\ncisely the reason they perform well on problems where order is  meaningful, such as\\nthe temperature-forecasting problem. A bidirectional RNN  exploits the order sensitiv-\\nity of RNN s :  i t  c o n s i s t s  o f  u s i n g  t w o  r e g u l a r  RNN s ,  s u c h  a s  t h e  GRU and LSTM  layers\\nyou’re already familiar with, each of which processes the input sequence in one direc-\\ntion (chronologically and an tichronologically), and then merging their representa-\\ntions. By processing a sequen ce both ways, a bidirectional RNN  can catch patterns that\\nmay be overlooked by a unidirectional RNN .\\n Remarkably, the fact that the RNN layers in this section have processed sequences in\\nchronological order (older timesteps first) ma y have been an arbitrary decision. At least,\\nit’s a decision we made no attempt to question so far. Could the RNNs have performed\\nwell enough if they processed input sequence s in antichronological order, for instance\\n(newer timesteps first)? Let’s try this in pr actice and see what happens. All you need to\\ndo is write a variant of the data generator where the input sequences are reverted along\\nthe time dimension (replace the last line with yield samples[:, ::-1, :],  targets ).\\nTraining the same one- GRU-layer network that you used in the first experiment in this\\nsection, you get the result s shown in figure 6.24.\\nFigure 6.23 Training and validation \\nloss on the Jena temperature-\\nforecasting task with a stacked GRU network\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 241}),\n",

But this set of\\nassumptions is too in flexible in a numb er of cases. Some\\nnetworks require several independent inputs, others\\nrequire multiple outputs, an d some networks have inter-\\nnal branching between layers that makes them look like\\ngraphs  of layers rather than linear stacks of layers.\\n Some tasks, for instance, require multimodal  inputs: they merge data coming from\\ndifferent input sources, processing each ty pe of data using different kinds of neural\\nlayers. Imagine a deep-learnin g model trying to predict the most likely market price of\\na second-hand piece of clothing, using th e following inputs: user-provided metadata\\n(such as the item’s brand, age, and so on),  a user-provided text description, and a pic-\\nture of the item. If you had only the metadata available, you could one-hot encode itand use a densely connected network to pred ict the price. If you had only the text\\ndescription available, you could use an \\nRNN  or a 1D convnet. If you had only the pic-\\nture, you could use a 2D convnet. But how can you use all three at the same time? A\\nnaive approach would be to train three sepa rate models and then do a weighted aver-\\nage of their predictions. But this may be suboptimal, because the information\\nextracted by the models may be redundant. A better way is to jointly  learn a more accu-\\nrate model of the data by using a model that can see all available input modalities\\nsimultaneously: a model with three input branches (see figure 7.2).\\nMerging\\nmodulePrice prediction\\nText description Metadata PictureDense module RNN module Convnet module\\nFigure 7.2 A multi-input modelLayerOutput\\nInputSequentialLayer\\nLayer\\nFigure 7.1 A Sequential  \\nmodel: a linear stack of layers\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 256}),\n",

That ’s the point of run-\\nning experiments: to get information about how well a model performs—as much\\ninformation as possible.  Making progress is an iterative process, or loop: you start with\\nan idea and express it as an experiment, atte mpting to validate or invalidate your idea.\\nYou run this experiment and process the info rmation it generates. This inspires your\\nnext idea. The more iterations  of this loop you’re able to run, the more refined and\\npowerful your ideas become. Keras helps you go from idea to experiment in the least\\npossible time, and fast GPUs can help you get from experi ment to result as quickly as\\npossible. But what about processing the ex periment results? That’s where Tensor-\\nBoard comes in.\\nThis section introduces TensorBoard, a br owser-based visualizat ion tool that comes\\npackaged with TensorFlow. Note that it’s only available for Keras models when you’re\\nusing Keras with the TensorFlow backend.\\n The key purpose of TensorBoard is to he lp you visually monitor everything that\\ngoes on inside your model during training . If you’re monitori ng more information\\nthan just the model’s final loss, you can de velop a clearer vision of what the model\\ndoes and doesn’t do, and you can make prog ress more quickly.

In this section, we’ll go beyond “works okay” to “works great and winsmachine-learning competitions” by offering  you a quick guide to a set of must-know\\ntechniques for building state-of -the-art deep-learning models.\\n7.3.1 Advanced architecture patterns\\nWe covered one important design pattern in  detail in the previous section: residual\\nconnections. There are two more design patt erns you should know about: normaliza-\\ntion and depthwise separable convolution.  These patterns are especially relevant\\nwhen you’re building high-performing de ep convnets, but they’re commonly found\\nin many other types of architectures as well.\\nBATCH NORMALIZATION\\nNormalization  is a broad category of methods that  seek to make different samples seen\\nby a machine-learning model more similar to each other, which helps the model learnand generalize well to new data. The most common form of data normalization is one\\nyou’ve seen several times in this book alread y: centering the data on 0 by subtracting\\nthe mean from the data, and gi ving the data a unit standard deviation by dividing the\\ndata by its standard deviatio n. In effect, this makes the assumption that the data fol-\\nlows a normal (or Gaussian) distribution an d makes sure this distribution is centered\\nand scaled to unit variance:\\nnormalized_data = (data - np.mean(data, axis=...)) / np.std(data, axis=...)\\nPrevious examples normalized data before feeding it into models. But data normaliza-\\ntion should be a concern after every transf ormation operated by the network: even if\\nthe data entering a Dense  or Conv2D  network has a 0 mean and unit variance, there’s\\nno reason to expect a priori that this will be the case for the data coming out.\\n Batch normalization is a type of layer ( BatchNormalization  in Keras) introduced\\nin 2015 by Ioffe and Szegedy;7 it can adaptively normalize data even as the mean and\\nvariance change over time during training. It works by internally maintaining an expo-\\nnential moving average of the batch-wise me an and variance of the data seen during\\ntraining. The main effect of batch normalizat ion is that it helps with gradient propa-\\ngation—much like residual connections—and  thus allows for deeper networks. Some\\nvery deep networks can only be trained if they include multiple BatchNormalization\\nlayers. For instance, BatchNormalization  is used liberally in many of the advanced\\nconvnet architectures that come packaged with Keras, such as ResNet50, Inception\\nV3, and Xception.\\n \\n7Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy, “Batch Normalizat ion: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing\\nInternal Covariate Shift,” Proceedings of the 32nd  International Conference on Machine Learning  (2015),\\nhttps:/ /arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167 .\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 282}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='261 Getting the most out of your models\\n The BatchNormalization  layer is typically used after a convolutional or densely\\nconnected layer:\\nconv_model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation=\\'relu\\'))\\nconv_model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())\\ndense_model.add(layers.Dense(32, activation=\\'relu\\'))\\ndense_model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())\\nThe BatchNormalization  layer takes an axis  argument, which specifies the feature\\naxis that should be normalized . This argument defaults to -1, the last axis in the input\\ntensor. This is the correct value when using Dense  layers, Conv1D  layers, RNN  layers,\\nand Conv2D  layers with data_format  set to \"channels_last\" . But in the niche use case\\nof Conv2D  layers with data_format  set to \"channels_first\" , the features axis is axis 1;\\nthe axis  argument in BatchNormalization  should accordingly be set to 1.\\nDEPTHWISE  SEPARABLE  CONVOLUTION\\nWhat if I told you that there’s a layer you can use as a drop-in replacement for Conv2D\\nthat will make your model lighter (fewer  trainable weight parameters) and faster\\n(fewer floating-point operations) and cause it to perform a few percentage points bet-\\nter on its task? That is precisely what the depthwise separable convolution  layer does\\n(SeparableConv2D ). This layer performs a spatial convolution on each channel of its\\ninput, independently, before mixing output  channels via a pointwise convolution (a\\n1 × 1 convolution), as shown in  figure 7.16. This is equiva lent to separating the learn-\\ning of spatial features and the learning of  channel-wise features, which makes a lot of\\nsense if you assume that spatial locations in  the input are highly correlated, but differ-\\nent channels are fairly independent. It re quires significantly fewer parameters and\\ninvolves fewer computations, thus resulting in smaller, sp eedier models. And because\\nit’s a more representationally efficient way to perform convolution,  it tends to learn\\nbetter representations using less data, resulting in better-performing models.After a Conv layer\\nAfter a Dense layer\\nBatch renormalization\\nA recent improvement over re gular batch normalization is batch renormalization , intro-\\nduced by Ioffe in 2017.a It offers clears benefits over batch normalization, at no appar-\\nent cost. At the time of writing, it’s too early to tell whether it will supplant batch\\nnormalization—but I think it’s likely. Even more recently, Klambauer et al. introduced\\nself-normalizing neural networks ,b which manage to keep data normalized after going\\nthrough any Dense  layer by using a specific activation function ( selu) and a specific ini-\\ntializer (lecun_normal ). This scheme, although highly interesting, is limited to densely\\nconnected networks for now, and its usef ulness hasn’t yet been broadly replicated. \\na Sergey Ioffe, “Batch Renormalization: Towards Reducing Minibatch Dependence in Batch-\\nNormalized Models” (2017), https://arxiv.o rg/abs/1702.03275 .\\nb Günter Klambauer et al., “Self-Normalizing Neural Networks,” Conference on Neural Informa-\\ntion Processing Systems (2017), https://arxiv.o rg/abs/1706.02515 .\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 283}),\n",

How many units or filters should go in\\neach layer? Should you use relu  as activation, or a different function? Should you use\\nBatchNormalization  after a given layer? How much dropout should you use? And so\\non. These architecture-level parameters are called hyperparameters  to distinguish them\\nfrom the parameters of a model, wh ich are trained vi a backpropagation.\\n In practice, experienced machine-learni ng engineers and researchers build intu-\\nition over time as to what  works and what doesn’t when it comes to these choices—\\nthey develop hyperparameter-tuning skills. Bu t there are no formal rules. If you want\\nto get to the very limit of what can be achieved on a given task, you can’t be content\\nwith arbitrary choices made by a fallible human. Your initial decisions are almost\\nalways suboptimal, even if you have good intuition. You can refine your choices by\\ntweaking them by hand and retraining the model repeatedly—that’s what machine-\\nlearning engineers and resear chers spend most of their ti me doing. But it shouldn’t\\nbe your job as a human to fiddle with hyperp arameters all day—that is better left to a\\nmachine.\\n Thus you need to explore the space of po ssible decisions auto matically, systemati-\\ncally, in a principled way. You need to sear ch the architecture sp ace and find the best-\\nperforming ones empirically. That’s what the field of automatic hyperparameter opti-\\nmization is about: it’s an entire fi eld of research, and an important one.\\n The process of optimizing hyperpar ameters typically looks like this:\\n1Choose a set of hyperparameters (automatically).\\n2Build the corresponding model.\\n3Fit it to your training data, and meas ure the final performance on the valida-\\ntion data.\\n4Choose the next set of hyperparameters to try (automatically).\\n5Repeat.\\n6Eventually, measure performance on your test data.\\nThe key to this process is the algorithm that uses this history of validation perfor-\\nmance, given various sets of  hyperparameters, to choose the next set of hyperparame-\\nters to evaluate. Many different techniqu es are possible: Bayesian optimization,\\ngenetic algorithms, simple random search, and so on.\\n Training the weights of a model is relati vely easy: you compute a loss function on a\\nmini-batch of data and then use the Back propagation algorithm to move the weights\\n8See note 5 above.\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 285}),\n",

Consider the following:\\n\\uf0a1Computing the feedback signal (does th is set of hyperparameters lead to a\\nhigh-performing model on this task?) ca n be extremely expensive: it requires\\ncreating and training a new mode l from scratch on your dataset.\\n\\uf0a1The hyperparameter space is typically made  of discrete decisions and thus isn’t\\ncontinuous or differentiable. Hence, yo u typically can’t do gradient descent in\\nhyperparameter space. Inst ead, you must rely on gradient-free optimization\\ntechniques, which naturally are far le ss efficient than gradient descent.\\nBecause these challenges are difficult and th e field is still young, we currently only\\nhave access to very limited tools to optimi ze models. Often, it turns out that random\\nsearch (choosing hyperparameters to evaluate  at random, repeatedly) is the best solu-\\ntion, despite being the most naive one. But one tool I have found reliably better than\\nrandom search is Hyperopt ( https:/ /github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt ), a Python\\nlibrary for hyperparameter opti mization that internally uses trees of Parzen estimators\\nto predict sets of hyperparameters that ar e likely to work well. Another library called\\nHyperas ( https:/ /github.com/maxpumperla/hyperas ) integrates Hyperopt for use\\nwith Keras models. Do check it out.\\nNOTE One important issue to keep in mi nd when doing automatic hyperpa-\\nrameter optimization at scale is validation-set overfitting. Because you’reupdating hyperparameters based on a signal that is computed using your vali-dation data, you’re effectively training them on the validation data, and thusthey will quickly overfit to the valida tion data. Always keep this in mind.\\nOverall, hyperparameter optimization is a powerful technique that is an absolute\\nrequirement to get to state-of-the-art mode ls on any task or to win machine-learning\\ncompetitions. Think about it: once upon a ti me, people handcrafted the features that\\nwent into shallow machine-learning mode ls. That was very much suboptimal. Now,\\ndeep learning automates the task of hier archical feature engineering—features are\\nlearned using a feedback signal, not hand-t uned, and that’s the way it should be. In\\nthe same way, you shouldn’t handcraft your  model architectures;  you should optimize\\nthem in a principled way. At the time of writing, the field of automatic hyperparame-\\nter optimization is very young and immature, as deep learning was some years ago, but\\nI expect it to boom in the next few years. \\n7.3.3 Model ensembling\\nAnother powerful technique for obtaining the best possible results on a task is model\\nensembling . Ensembling consists of pooling togeth er the predictions of a set of differ-\\nent models, to produce better  predictions. If you look at machine-learning competi-\\ntions, in particular on Kaggle, you’ll see that the winners use very large ensembles of\\nmodels that inevitably beat any si ngle model, no matter how good.\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 286}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='265 Getting the most out of your models\\n Ensembling relies on the assumption th at different good models trained inde-\\npendently are likely to be good for different reasons : each model looks at slightly differ-\\nent aspects of the data to make  its predictions, getting part  of the “truth” but not all of\\nit. You may be familiar with the ancient pa rable of the blind men and the elephant: a\\ngroup of blind men come across an elephant  for the first time and try to understand\\nwhat the elephant is by touching it. Each  man touches a different part of the ele-\\nphant’s body—just one part, su ch as the trunk or a leg. Then the men describe to\\neach other what an elephant is: “It’s like a snake,” “Like a pillar or  a tree,” and so on.\\nThe blind men are essentially machine-learning models tryi ng to understand the man-\\nifold of the training data, each from its own perspective, using its own assumptions\\n(provided by the unique architecture of th e model and the unique random weight ini-\\ntialization). Each of them gets part of the truth of the data, but not the whole truth. Bypooling their perspectives together, you can get a far more accurate description of thedata. The elephant is a combination of part s: not any single blind man gets it quite\\nright, but, interviewed together, they can tell a fairly accurate story.\\n Let’s use classification as an  example. The easiest way to pool the predictions of a set\\nof classifiers (to ensemble the classifiers ) is to average their pred ictions at inference time:\\npreds_a = model_a.predict(x_val)\\npreds_b = model_b.predict(x_val)preds_c = model_c.predict(x_val)\\npreds_d = model_d.predict(x_val)\\nfinal_preds = 0.25 * (preds_a + preds_b + preds_c + preds_d)\\nThis will work only if the cl assifiers are more or less equally good. If one of them is sig-\\nnificantly worse than the others, the final predictions may not be as good as the best\\nclassifier of the group.\\n A smarter way to ensemble classifiers is to do a weighted average, where the\\nweights are learned on the validation data—t ypically, the better classifiers are given a\\nhigher weight, and the worse classifiers are given a lower weight. To search for a good\\nset of ensembling weights, you can use random  search or a simple optimization algo-\\nrithm such as Nelder-Mead:\\npreds_a = model_a.predict(x_val)\\npreds_b = model_b.predict(x_val)\\npreds_c = model_c.predict(x_val)\\npreds_d = model_d.predict(x_val)\\nfinal_preds = 0.5 * preds_a + 0.25 * preds_b + 0.1 * preds_c + 0.15 * preds_d\\nThere are many possible variants: you can do an average of an exponential of the pre-\\ndictions, for instance.

Diversity is what makes ensembling  work. In machine-lear ning terms, if all\\nof your models are biased in the same way,  then your ensemble will retain this same\\nbias. If your models are biased in different ways , the biases will cancel each other out,\\nand the ensemble will be more  robust and more accurate.\\n For this reason, you should ensemble models that are as good as possible  while being\\nas different as possible . This typically means using very  different architectures or even\\ndifferent brands of machin e-learning approaches. One thing that is largely not worth\\ndoing is ensembling the same  network trained several times independently, from dif-\\nferent random initializations. If the only di fference between your models is their ran-\\ndom initialization and the order in which they  were exposed to the training data, then\\nyour ensemble will be low-diversity and will  provide only a tiny improvement over any\\nsingle model.\\n One thing I have found to work well in practice—but that doesn’t generalize to\\nevery problem domain—is the use of an ense mble of tree-based methods (such as ran-\\ndom forests or gr adient-boosted trees) and deep ne ural networks. In 2014, partner\\nAndrei Kolev and I took fourth place in the Higgs Boson decay detection challenge\\non Kaggle (www.kaggle.com/ c/higgs-boson) using an ensemble of various tree mod-\\nels and deep neural networks . Remarkably, one of the mode ls in the ensemble origi-\\nnated from a different method than the others (it was a regularized greedy forest) and\\nhad a significantly worse score than the othe rs. Unsurprisingly, it was assigned a small\\nweight in the ensemble. But to our surpri se, it turned out to improve the overall\\nensemble by a large factor, because it was so  different from every other model: it pro-\\nvided information that the other models di dn’t have access to. That’s precisely the\\npoint of ensembling. It’s not so much abou t how good your best model is; it’s about\\nthe diversity of your set of candidate models.\\n In recent times, one style of basic ensemb le that has been very successful in prac-\\ntice is the wide and deep  category of models, blending de ep learning with shallow learn-\\ning. Such models consist of jointly training  a deep neural network with a large linear\\nmodel. The joint training of a family of  diverse models is yet another option to\\nachieve model ensembling. \\n7.3.4 Wrapping up\\n\\uf0a1When building high-performing deep convne ts, you’ll need to use residual con-\\nnections, batch normalization, and dept hwise separable convolutions.

In many fields, but\\nespecially in creative ones, AI will be used by humans as a tool to augment their own\\ncapabilities: more augmented  intelligence than artificial  intelligence.\\n A large part of artistic creation consists  of simple pattern recognition and technical\\nskill. And that’s precisely the part of the pr ocess that many find less attractive or even\\ndispensable. That’s where AI comes in. Our perceptual modalities, our language, and\\nour artwork all have statistica l structure. Learning this st ructure is what deep-learning\\nalgorithms excel at. Machine-learning  models can learn the statistical latent space  of\\nimages, music, and stories, and they can then sample  from this space, creating new art-\\nworks with characteristics similar to those th e model has seen in its training data. Nat-\\nurally, such sampling is hardly an act of artistic creation in itself. It’s a mere\\nmathematical operation: th e algorithm has no groundin g in human life, human emo-\\ntions, or our experience of the world; instead, it learns from an experience that has lit-tle in common with ours. It’s only our in terpretation, as human spectators, that will\\ngive meaning to what the model generates. But in the hands of a skilled artist, algo-\\nrithmic generation can be steered to be come meaningful—and beautiful. Latent\\nspace sampling can become a brush that em powers the artist, augments our creative\\naffordances, and expands the space of what we can imagine. What’s more, it can make\\nartistic creation more accessible by elimin ating the need for tec hnical skill and prac-\\ntice—setting up a new medium of pure ex pression, factoring art apart from craft.\\n Iannis Xenakis, a visionary pioneer of el ectronic and algorith mic music, beauti-\\nfully expressed this same idea in the 1960s, in the context of the application of auto-mation technology to music composition:\\n1\\nFreed from tedious calculations, the composer is able to devote himself to the general\\nproblems that the new musical form poses and to explore the nooks and crannies of this\\nform while modifying the values of the in put data.

Successful applications of sequence data generation with recurrent net-\\nworks only began to appear in the mainstre am in 2016. But these techniques have a\\nfairly long history, starting with the development of the LSTM  algorithm in 1997.2 This\\nnew algorithm was used early on to ge nerate text character by character.\\n In 2002, Douglas Eck, then at Schm idhuber’s lab in Switzerland, applied LSTM  to\\nmusic generation for the first time, with pr omising results. Eck is now a researcher at\\nGoogle Brain, and in 2016 he started a new research group there, called Magenta,\\nfocused on applying modern deep-learnin g techniques to produce engaging music.\\nSometimes, good ideas take  15 years to get started.\\n In the late 2000s and early 2010s, Alex Graves did important pioneering work on\\nusing recurrent networks for sequence data  generation. In particular, his 2013 work\\non applying recurrent mixtur e density networks to generate human-like handwriting\\nusing timeseries of pen positions is seen by some as a turning point.3 This specific\\napplication of neural networks at that spec ific moment in time captured for me the\\nnotion of machines that dream  and was a significant insp iration around the time I\\nstarted developing Keras.

              " Document(page_content='272 CHAPTER  8Generative deep learning\\n8.1.2 How do you generate sequence data?\\nThe universal way to generate sequence data in  deep learning is to train a network (usu-\\nally an RNN  or a convnet) to predict the next to ken or next few tokens in a sequence,\\nusing the previous tokens as input. For inst ance, given the input “the cat is on the ma,”\\nthe network is trained to predict the target t, the next character. As usual when working\\nwith text data, tokens  are typically words or characters , and any network that can model\\nthe probability of the next token give n the previous ones is called a language model . A\\nlanguage model captures the latent space  of language: its statistical structure.\\n Once you have such a trained language model, you can sample  from it (generate\\nnew sequences): you feed it an initial string of text (called conditioning data ), ask it to\\ngenerate the next character or the next word  (you can even generate several tokens at\\nonce), add the generated output back to the input data, and repeat the process many\\ntimes (see figure 8.1). This loop allows yo u to generate sequences of arbitrary length\\nthat reflect the structure of  the data on which the mode l was trained: sequences that\\nlook almost  like human-written sentences. In th e example we present in this section,\\nyou’ll take a LSTM  layer, feed it strings of N characters extracted from a text corpus,\\nand train it to predict character N + 1. The output of the model will be a softmax over\\nall possible characters: a probability dist ribution for the next character. This LSTM  is\\ncalled a character-level neural language model . \\n8.1.3 The importance of the sampling strategy\\nWhen generating text, the way you choose the next character is crucially important. A\\nnaive approach is greedy sampling , consisting of always choosing the most likely next\\ncharacter. But such an approach results in  repetitive, predictable strings that don’t\\nlook like coherent language. A more intere sting approach makes slightly more sur-\\nprising choices: it introduces randomness in  the sampling proce ss, by sampling from\\nthe probability distribution for the next character. This is called stochastic sampling\\n(recall that stochasticity  is what we call randomness  in this field). In such a setup, if e has\\na probability 0.3 of being the next characte r, according to the model, you’ll choose itLanguage\\nmodelInitial textProbability\\ndistribution for the\\nnext character Initial textSampled next\\ncharacter\\nSampling\\nstrategya The cat sat on the m\\nLanguage\\nmodel\\n...Sampling\\nstrategyt The cat sat on the ma\\nFigure 8.1 The process of character-by-charact er text generation using a language model\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 294}),\n",

Note that greedy sampling ca n be also cast as sampling from a prob-\\nability distribution: one where a certain char acter has probability 1 and all others have\\nprobability 0.\\n Sampling probabilistically from the softma x output of the mode l is neat: it allows\\neven unlikely characters to be sampled some of the time, generating more interesting-\\nlooking sentences and sometime s showing creativity by comi ng up with new, realistic-\\nsounding words that didn’t occur in the tr aining data. But there’ s one issue with this\\nstrategy: it doesn’t offer a way to control the amount of randomness  in the sampling process.\\n Why would you want more or less rand omness? Consider an extreme case: pure\\nrandom sampling, where you draw the next character from a unif orm probability dis-\\ntribution, and every characte r is equally likely. This scheme has maximum random-\\nness; in other words, this probability distri bution has maximum entropy. Naturally, it\\nwon’t produce anything interesting. At th e other extreme, greedy sampling doesn’t\\nproduce anything interesting, either, an d has no randomness: the corresponding\\nprobability distribution has minimum entropy. Sampling from the “real” probability\\ndistribution—the distribution  that is output by the mo del’s softmax fu nction—consti-\\ntutes an intermediate point between thes e two extremes. But there are many other\\nintermediate points of higher or lower entropy that you may want to explore. Less\\nentropy will give the generated sequences a more predictable structure (and thus they\\nwill potentially be more realistic looking) , whereas more entropy will result in more\\nsurprising and creative sequen ces. When sampling from generative models, it’s always\\ngood to explore different amounts of rand omness in the generation process. Because\\nwe—humans—are the ultimate judges of how interesting the generated data is, inter-\\nestingness is highly subjective, and there’ s no telling in advance where the point of\\noptimal entropy lies.\\n In order to control the amount of stochast icity in the sampling process, we’ll intro-\\nduce a parameter called the softmax temperature  that characterizes the entropy of the\\nprobability distribution used for sampling: it characterizes how su rprising or predict-\\nable the choice of the next character will be. Given a temperature  value, a new proba-\\nbility distribution is comp uted from the original one (the softmax output of the\\nmodel) by reweighting it  in the following way.\\nimport numpy as np\\ndef reweight_distribution(original_distribution, temperature=0.5):\\ndistribution = np.log(original_distribution) / temperature\\ndistribution = np.exp(distribution)return distribution / np.sum(distribution)Listing 8.1 Reweighting a probability distribution to a different temperature\\noriginal_distribution is a 1D Numpy array \\nof probability values that must sum to 1. \\ntemperature is a factor quantifying the \\nentropy of the outp ut distribution.Returns a reweighted version of \\nthe original distribution.

For simpli city, this section focuses on the formula-\\ntion described in the original paper.\\n Neural style transfer consis ts of applying the style of a reference image to a target\\nimage while conserving the content of the ta rget image. Figure 8.7 shows an example.\\nIn this context, style essentially means textur es, colors, and visual patterns in the image, at\\nvarious spatial scales; and the content  is the higher-level macrostructure of the image.\\nFor instance, blue-and-yellow circular brushstr okes are considered to be the style in fig-\\nure 8.7 (using Starry Night  by Vincent Van Gogh), and the buildings in the Tübingen\\nphotograph are considered to be the content.\\n The idea of style transfer, which is tightl y related to that of texture generation, has\\nhad a long history in the image-processi ng community prior to the development of\\nneural style transfer in 2015. But as it tu rns out, the deep-learning-based implementa-\\ntions of style transfer offer results unparalleled by what had been previously achieved\\nwith classical computer-vision techniques, and they triggered an amazing renaissance\\nin creative applications of computer vision.\\n The key notion behind implementing style transfer is the same idea that’s central\\nto all deep-learning algorithms: you define a loss function to spec ify what you want to\\nachieve, and you minimize this loss. You kn ow what you want to achieve: conserving\\nthe content of the original image while adop ting the style of the reference image. If\\nwe were able to mathematically define content  and style, then an appropriate loss func-\\ntion to minimize would be the following:\\nloss = distance(style(reference_image) - style(generated_image)) +\\ndistance(content(original_image) - content(generated_image))\\n5Leon A.

              " Document(page_content='288 CHAPTER  8Generative deep learning\\nHere, distance  is a norm function such as the L2 norm, content  is a function that\\ntakes an image and computes a representation of its content, and style  is a function\\nthat takes an image and computes a repres entation of its style. Minimizing this\\nloss causes style(generated_image)  to be close to style(reference_image) , and\\ncontent(generated_image)  is close to content(generated_image) , thus achieving\\nstyle transfer as we defined it.\\n A fundamental observation made by Gatys et al. was that deep convolutional neu-\\nral networks offer a way to mathematically define the style  and content  functions.\\nLet’s see how.\\n8.3.1 The content loss\\nAs you already know, activations from earlier layers in a network contain local informa-\\ntion about the image, wherea s activations from higher layers contain increasingly global ,\\nabstract  information. Formulated in a different way, the activations of the different lay-\\ners of a convnet provide a decomposition of th e contents of an image over different spa-\\ntial scales. Therefore, you’d expect the content of an image, which is more global and\\nabstract, to be captured by the represen tations of the upper layers in a convnet.\\n A good candidate for content loss is thus  the L2 norm between the activations of\\nan upper layer in a pretrained convnet, comp uted over the target image, and the acti-\\nvations of the same layer computed over th e generated image. This guarantees that, as\\nseen from the upper layer, the generated imag e will look similar to the original target\\nimage. Assuming that what the upper layers  of a convnet see is really the content of\\ntheir input images, then this works as  a way to preserve image content. \\n8.3.2 The style loss\\nThe content loss only uses a single upper la yer, but the style loss as defined by Gatys\\net al. uses multiple layers of a convnet: yo u try to capture the appearance of the style-\\nreference image at all spatial scales extracte d by the convnet, not just a single scale.\\nFor the style loss, Gatys et al. use the Gram matrix  of a layer’s activations: the inner\\nproduct of the feature maps of a given laye r. This inner product can be understood as\\nrepresenting a map of the correlations betw een the layer’s features. These feature cor-\\nrelations capture the statistics of the patterns  of a particular spat ial scale, which empir-\\nically correspond to the appearance of the textures found at this scale.\\n Hence, the style loss aims to preserve simi lar internal correlations within the activa-\\ntions of different layers, across the style- reference image and the generated image. In\\nturn, this guarantees that the textures foun d at different spatial scales look similar\\nacross the style-reference image and the generated image.\\n In short, you can use a pretrained convnet to define a loss that will do the following:\\n\\uf0a1Preserve content by maintaining similar high-level layer activations between the\\ntarget content image and the generated image.

The module capable of realizing this mapping, taking as input\\na latent point and outputting an image (a grid of pixels), is called a generator  (in the\\ncase of GANs) or a decoder  (in the case of VAEs). Once such a latent space has been\\ndeveloped, you can sample points from it, either deliberately or at random, and, by\\nmapping them to image space, generate images that have never been seen before (seefigure 8.9).\\nGAN s and VAEs are two different strategies for lear ning such latent spaces of image\\nrepresentations, each with  its own characteristics. VAEs are great for learning latent\\nspaces that are well structured , where specific directions encode a meaningful axis of\\nvariation in the data.

It’s then trained by\\nusing as target data the same images  as the input images, meaning the autoencoder\\nlearns to reconstruct the original inputs.

They also work\\nnicely for doing latent-space-based animat ions, such as animating a walk along a\\ncross section of the latent space, showin g a starting image sl owly morphing into\\ndifferent images in a continuous way.\\n\\uf0a1GAN s enable the generation of realistic single-frame images but may not induce\\nlatent spaces with solid st ructure and high continuity.\\nMost successful practical applications I have seen with images rely on VAEs, but GAN s\\nare extremely popular in the world of ac ademic research—at least, circa 2016–2017.\\nYou’ll find out how they work and how to implement one in the next section.\\nTIP To play further with image generati on, I suggest working with the Large-\\nscale Celeb Faces Attributes (CelebA) da taset. It’s a free-to-download image\\ndataset containing more than 200,000 cele brity portraits. It’s great for experi-\\nmenting with concept vectors in part icular—it definitely beats MNIST. \\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 326}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='305 Introduction to generative adversarial networks\\n8.5 Introduction to generative adversarial networks\\nGenerative adversarial networks ( GAN s), introduced in 2014 by Goodfellow et al.,8 are\\nan alternative to VAEs for learning latent spaces of images. They enable the generation\\nof fairly realistic synthetic images by forcing the generated images to be statistically\\nalmost indistinguishable from real ones.\\n An intuitive way to understand GAN s is to imagine a forger trying to create a fake\\nPicasso painting. At first, the forger is pr etty bad at the task. He mixes some of his\\nfakes with authentic Picassos and shows them all to an art dealer. The art dealer makes\\nan authenticity assessment for each painting  and gives the forger  feedback about what\\nmakes a Picasso look like a Picasso. The forger  goes back to his studio to prepare some\\nnew fakes. As times goes on, the forger be comes increasingly competent at imitating\\nthe style of Picasso, and the art dealer beco mes increasingly expert  at spotting fakes.\\nIn the end, they have on their hands some excellent fake Picassos.\\n That’s what a GAN is: a forger network and an expe rt network, each being trained\\nto best the other. As such, a GAN is made of two parts:\\n\\uf0a1Generator network —Takes as input a random vect or (a random point in the\\nlatent space), and decodes it into a synthetic image\\n\\uf0a1Discriminator network (or adversary) —Takes as input an image (real or synthetic),\\nand predicts whether the image came fr om the training set or was created by\\nthe generator network.\\nThe generator network is trained to be able  to fool the discriminator network, and\\nthus it evolves toward generating increasingly  realistic images as training goes on: arti-\\nficial images that look indistinguishable from  real ones, to the extent that it’s impossi-\\nble for the discriminator network to tell th e two apart (see figu re 8.15). Meanwhile,\\nthe discriminator is constantly adapting to the gradually improving capabilities of the\\ngenerator, setting a high bar of realism for the generated images. Once training is\\nover, the generator is capable of turning an y point in its input space into a believable\\nimage. Unlike VAEs, this latent space has fewer ex plicit guarantees of meaningful\\nstructure; in particular, it isn’t continuous.\\n8Ian Goodfellow et al., “Generative Ad versarial Networks,” arXiv (2014), https:/ /arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661 .\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 327}),\n",

              " Document(page_content='307 Introduction to generative adversarial networks\\n8.5.1 A schematic GAN implementation\\nIn this section, we’ll explain how to implement a GAN in Keras, in its barest form—\\nbecause GAN s are advanced, diving d eeply into the technical details would be out of\\nscope for this book. The spec ific implementation is a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN ):\\na GAN  where the generator and discriminator ar e deep convnets. In particular, it uses\\na Conv2DTranspose  layer for image upsampling in the generator.\\n You’ll train the GAN o n im age s  fr om  CIFAR10 , a dataset of 50,000 32 × 32 RGB\\nimages belonging to 10 classes (5,000 images per class). To make things easier, you’ll\\nonly use images belonging to the class “frog.”\\n Schematically, the GAN looks like this:\\n1A generator  network maps vectors of shape (latent_dim,)  to images of shape\\n(32,  32, 3).\\n2A discriminator  network maps images of shape (32,  32, 3) to a binary score\\nestimating the probability that the image is real.\\n3A gan network chains the generator and the discriminator together: gan(x) =\\ndiscriminator(generator(x)) . Thus this gan network maps latent space vec-\\ntors to the discriminator’ s assessment of the realism of these latent vectors as\\ndecoded by the generator.\\n4You train the discriminator using examples  of real and fake images along with\\n“real”/“fake” labels, just as you train any regular image-classification model.\\n5To train the generator, you use the gr adients of the generator’s weights with\\nregard to the loss of the gan model. This means, at every step, you move the\\nweights of the generator in a direction that makes the discriminator more likely\\nto classify as “real” the images decoded by the generator. In other words, you\\ntrain the generator to fool the discriminator. \\n8.5.2 A bag of tricks\\nThe process of training GANs and tuning GAN implementations is notoriously diffi-\\ncult. There are a number of known tricks yo u should keep in mi nd. Like most things\\nin deep learning, it’s more  alchemy than science: thes e tricks are heuristics, not\\ntheory-backed guidelines. They’re supported by a level of intuitive understanding of\\nthe phenomenon at hand, and they’re known to work well empirically, although not\\nnecessarily in every context.\\n Here are a few of the tricks us ed in the implementation of the GAN generator and\\ndiscriminator in this section. It isn’t an exhaustive list of GAN-related tips; you’ll find\\nmany more across the GAN  literature:\\n\\uf0a1We use tanh  as the last activation in the generator, instead of sigmoid , which is\\nmore commonly found in other types of models.\\n\\uf0a1We sample points from the latent space using a normal distribution  (Gaussian dis-\\ntribution), not a uniform distribution.\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 329}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='308 CHAPTER  8Generative deep learning\\n\\uf0a1Stochasticity is good to induce robustness. Because GAN training results in a\\ndynamic equilibrium, GANs are likely to get stuck in all sorts of ways. Introduc-\\ning randomness during training helps prevent this. We introduce randomness\\nin two ways: by using dropout in the di scriminator and by adding random noise\\nto the labels for the discriminator.\\n\\uf0a1Sparse gradients can hinder GAN training. In deep learni ng, sparsity is often a\\ndesirable property, but not in GANs. Two things can induce gradient sparsity:\\nmax pooling operations and ReLU  activations. Instead of  max pooling, we rec-\\nommend using strided convolutions for downsampling, and we recommend\\nusing a LeakyReLU  layer instead of a ReLU  activation. It’s similar to ReLU , but it\\nrelaxes sparsity constraints by allowi ng small negative activation values.\\n\\uf0a1In generated images, it’s common to see checkerboard artifacts caused by\\nunequal coverage of the pixel space in the generator (see figure 8.17). To fix\\nthis, we use a kernel size that’s divisibl e by the stride size whenever we use a\\nstrided Conv2DTranpose  or Conv2D  in both the generator and the discriminator. \\n8.5.3 The generator\\nFirst, let’s develop a generator  model that turns a vector (from the latent space—\\nd u r i n g  t r a i n i n g  i t  w i l l  b e  s a m p l e d  a t  r a ndom) into a candidate image.

If you ever need a\\nquick refresher to help you recall what yo u’ve learned, you can read these few pages.\\n9.1.1 Various approaches to AI\\nFirst of all, deep learning isn’t synonymous with AI or even with machine learning.\\nArtificial intelligence  is an ancient, broad field that can generally be defined as “all\\nattempts to automate cognitive proce sses”—in other words, the automation of\\nthought. This can range from the very basic,  such as an Excel spreadsheet, to the very\\nadvanced, like a humanoid robot that can walk and talk.\\n Machine learning  is a specific subfield of AI that aims at auto matically developing\\nprograms (called models ) purely from exposure to traini ng data. This process of turn-\\ning data into a program is called learning . Although machine learning has been\\naround for a long time, it only started to take off in the 1990s.\\n Deep learning  is one of many branches of machine learning, where the models are\\nlong chains of geometric functions, applie d one after the other. These operations are\\nstructured into modules called layers : deep-learning models are typically stacks of lay-\\ners—or, more generally, graphs of laye rs. These layers are parameterized by weights ,\\nwhich are the parameters learned during training. The knowledge  of a model is stored\\nin its weights, and the process of learning consists of finding good values for these\\nweights.\\n Even though deep learning is just one among many approaches to machine learn-\\ning, it isn’t on an equal footing with the others. Deep learning is a breakout success.\\nHere’s why. \\n9.1.2 What makes deep learning special \\nwithin the field of machine learning\\nIn the span of only a few years, deep learning has achieved  tremendous break-\\nthroughs across a wide range of tasks th at have been histor ically perceived as\\nextremely difficult for comput ers, especially in the area of machine perception:\\nextracting useful information from images , videos, sound, and more. Given sufficient\\ntraining data (in particular, training data appropriately labeled by  humans), it’s possi-\\nble to extract from perceptual data almost anythi ng that a human could extract.\\nHence, it’s sometimes said  that deep learning has solved perception , although that’s true\\nonly for a fairly narrow definition of perception .\\n Due to its unprecedented technical succ esses, deep learning has singlehandedly\\nbrought about the third and by far the largest AI summer : a period of intense interest,\\ninvestment, and hype in the field of AI. As this book is being written, we’re in the middle\\nof it. Whether this period will end in the ne ar future, and what happens after it ends,\\nare topics of debate. One thing is certain: in stark contrast with previous AI summers,\\ndeep learning has provided enormous business value to a number of large technology\\ncompanies, enabling human-le vel speech recognition, sma rt assistants, human-level\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 337}),\n",

The hype may\\n(and likely will) recede, but the sustained economic and technological impact of deep\\nlearning will remain. In that sense, deep learning could be anal ogous to the internet:\\nit may be overly hyped up for a few years, but in the longer term it will still be a major\\nrevolution that will transf orm our economy and our lives.\\n I’m particularly optimistic about deep learning because even if we were to make no\\nfurther technological progre ss in the next decade, deploying existing algorithms to\\nevery applicable problem would be a game changer for most industries. Deep learn-\\ning is nothing short of a revolution, and pr ogress is currently happening at an incred-\\nibly fast rate, due to an exponential investment in resources and headcount. From\\nwhere I stand, the future l ooks bright, although short-te rm expectations are somewhat\\noveroptimistic; deploying deep learning to the full extent of its potential will take well\\nover a decade. \\n9.1.3 How to think about deep learning\\nThe most surprising thing abou t deep learning is how simp le it is. Ten years ago, no\\none expected that we would achieve such  amazing results on machine-perception\\nproblems by using simple parametric models trained with gradient descent. Now, itturns out that all you need is sufficiently large parametric models  trained with gradi-\\nent descent on sufficiently many examples. As Feynman once said about the universe,\\n“It’s not complicated, it’s just a lot of it.”\\n1\\n In deep learning, everything is a vector: everything is a point  in a geometric space .\\nModel inputs (text, images, and so on) and targets are first vectorized : turned into an\\ninitial input vector space and target vector space. Each layer in a deep-learning model\\noperates one simple geometric transformati on on the data that goes through it.\\nTogether, the chain of layers in the mode l forms one complex geometric transforma-\\ntion, broken down into a series of simple  ones. This complex transformation attempts\\nto map the input space to the target space, one point at a time. Th is transformation is\\nparameterized by the weights of the layers, which are iteratively updated based on how\\nwell the model is currently performing. A key characteristic of this geometric transfor-\\nmation is that it must be differentiable , which is required in order for us to be able to\\nlearn its parameters via gradient descent. Intuitively, this means the geometric morph-\\ning from inputs to outputs must be smoot h and continuous—a significant constraint.\\n The entire process of applying this comp lex geometric transformation to the input\\ndata can be visualized in 3D by imagining a person trying to uncrumple a paper ball:\\nthe crumpled paper ball is th e manifold of the input data that the model starts with.\\nEach movement operated by the person on the paper ball is similar to a simple geo-\\nmetric transformation operat ed by one layer. The full uncrumpling gesture sequence\\nis the complex transformation of the enti re model. Deep-learning models are mathe-\\nmatical machines for uncrumpling complicat ed manifolds of high-dimensional data.\\n1Richard Feynman, interview, The World from Another Point of View , Yorkshire Television, 1972.\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 338}),\n",

All you need are spaces of sufficiently high dimensionality in\\norder to capture the full scope of the re lationships found in the original data.\\n The whole thing hinges on a single core idea: that meaning is derived from the pairwise\\nrelationship between things  (between words in a language , between pixels in an image,\\nand so on) and that these relationships can be capt ured by a distance function . But note that\\nwhether the brain implements meaning via geometric spaces is an entirely separate\\nquestion. Vector spaces are efficient to work with from a co mputational standpoint,\\nbut different data structures for intelligence can easily be envisioned—in particular,graphs.

Ever yone needs to build\\nintelligent apps: just as every business toda y needs a website, every product will need\\nto intelligently make sense of user-generat ed data. Bringing a bout this future will\\nrequire us to build tools that make deep le arning radically easy to use and accessible\\nto anyone with basic coding abilities. Keras is the first major step in that direction. \\n9.1.5 The universal machine-learning workflow\\nHaving access to an extremely powerful tool  for creating models that map any input\\nspace to any target space is great, but the difficult part of the machine-learning work-\\nflow is often everything that comes before  designing and training such models (and,\\nfor production models, what comes afte r, as well). Understanding the problem\\ndomain so as to be able to determine what to attempt to predict, given what data, and\\nhow to measure success, is a prerequisite  for any successful a pplication of machine\\nlearning, and it isn’t something that adva nced tools like Keras and TensorFlow can\\nhelp you with. As a reminder, here’s a qu ick summary of the typical machine-learning\\nworkflow as described in chapter 4:\\n1Define the problem: What data is availa ble, and what are you trying to predict?\\nWill you need to collect more data or hi re people to manually label a dataset?\\n2Identify a way to reliably measure succe ss on your goal. For simple tasks, this\\nmay be prediction accuracy, but in many cases it will require sophisticated\\ndomain-specific metrics.\\n3Prepare the validation process that you’ll use to evaluate your models. In partic-\\nular, you should define a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The valida-\\ntion- and test-set labels shouldn’t leak into the training data: for instance, with\\ntemporal prediction, the validation and test data should be  posterior to the\\ntraining data.\\n4Vectorize the data by turning it into ve ctors and preprocessing  it in a way that\\nmakes it more easily approachable by a neural network (normalization, and so\\non).\\n5Develop a first model that beats a triv ial common-sense base line, thus demon-\\nstrating that machine learning can work  on your problem. This may not always\\nbe the case!\\n6Gradually refine your mode l architecture by tuning  hyperparameters and add-\\ning regularization. Make changes based on performance on the validation data\\nonly, not the test data or the training data. Remember that you should get your\\nmodel to overfit (thus identifying a model capacity level that’s greater than youneed) and only then begin to add regularization or downsize your model.\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 340}),\n",

Each type of network is\\nmeant for a specific input modality: a ne twork architecture (dense, convolutional,\\nrecurrent) encodes assumptions  about the structure of the data: a hypothesis space  within\\nwhich the search for a good model will proceed. Whether a given architecture will\\nwork on a given problem depends entirely on the match between the structure of the\\ndata and the assumptions of  the network architecture.\\n These different network ty pes can easily be combined to achieve larger multi-\\nmodal networks, much as you combine LEGO  bricks.

Such networks assume no specific structure in the input features:they’re called densely connected  because the units of a \\nDense  layer are connected to every\\nother unit. The layer attempts to map relati onships between any two input features; this\\nis unlike a 2D convolution layer, for instance, which only looks at local relationships.\\n Densely connected networks are most commonly used for categorical data (for\\nexample, where the input features are lists of  attributes), such as the Boston Housing\\nPrice dataset used in chapter 3. They’re also used as the final classification or regres-\\nsion stage of most networks.

This results\\nin representations that are translation invariant , making convolution layers highly data\\nefficient and modular. This idea is appl icable to spaces of  any dimensionality: 1D\\n(sequences), 2D (images), 3D (volumes), and so on. You can use the Conv1D  layer to\\nprocess sequences (especially text—it doesn’t work as well on timeseries, which often\\ndon’t follow the translation- invariance assumption), the Conv2D  layer to process\\nimages, and the Conv3D  layers to process volumes.\\n Convnets , or convolutional networks , consist of stacks of convolution and max-pooling\\nlayers. The pooling layers let you spatially downsample the data, which is required to\\nkeep feature maps to a reason able size as the number of features grows, and to allow\\nsubsequent convolution layers to “see” a gr eater spatial extent of the inputs. Convnets\\nare often ended with either a Flatten  operation or a global pooling layer, turning spa-\\ntial feature maps into vectors, followed by Dense  layers to achieve classification or\\nregression.\\n Note that it’s highly likely that regular convolutions will soon be mostly (or com-\\npletely) replaced by an equivalent but fast er and representational ly efficient alterna-\\ntive: the depthwise separable convolution  (SeparableConv2D  layer).

Even with this data, you could not train a\\ndeep-learning model to read a product description and generate the appropriatecodebase. That’s just one example among ma ny. In general, anything that requires\\nreasoning—like programming or applying the scientific method—long-term plan-\\nning, and algorithmic data manipulation is  out of reach for deep-learning models, no\\nmatter how much data you throw at them. Even learning a sorting algorithm with a\\ndeep neural network is tremendously difficult.\\n This is because a deep-learning model is just a chain of simple, co ntinuous geometric\\ntransformations  mapping one vector space into another. All it can do is map one data\\nmanifold \\nX into another manifold Y, assuming the existence of a learnable continuous\\ntransform from X to Y. A deep-learning model can be interpreted as a kind of pro-\\ngram; but, inversely, most programs can’t be expressed as deep-learning models —for most\\ntasks, either there exists no corresponding deep-neural network that  solves the task or,\\neven if one exists, it may not be learnable : the corresponding geometric transform may\\nbe far too complex, or there may not be appropriate data ava ilable to learn it.\\n Scaling up current deep-learning techniqu e s  b y  s t a c k i n g  m o r e  l a y e r s  a n d  u s i n g\\nmore training data can only superficially pa lliate some of these issues.

Applied\\nto deep learning, this means that, for inst ance, when we’re able to somewhat success-\\nfully train a model to generate captions to describe pictures, we’re led to believe that\\nthe model “understands” the contents of the pictures and the captions it generates.\\nThen we’re surprised when any slight departur e from the sort of images present in the\\ntraining data causes the model to generate co mpletely absurd captions (see figure 9.1).\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 347}),\n",

Machine-learning models have\\nno access to such experiences and thus ca n’t understand their inputs in a human-\\nrelatable way. By annotating large numbers of training exam ples to feed into our mod-\\nels, we get them to learn a geometric tran sform that maps data to human concepts on\\na specific set of examples, but this mapping is a simplistic sketch of the original model\\nin our minds—the one developed from our ex perience as embodied agents.

This is how we’ll get to reasoning  and\\nabstraction , the lack of which is the fundam ental weakness of current models.\\n\\uf0a1New forms of learning that make the previous point possible , allowing models to move\\naway from differentiable transforms.\\n\\uf0a1Models that require less involvement from human engineers . It shouldn’t be your job to\\ntune knobs endlessly.\\n\\uf0a1Greater, systematic reuse of previously learned features and architectures , such as meta-\\nlearning systems using reusable and modular program subroutines.\\nAdditionally, note that these considerations aren’t specific to the sort of supervised\\nlearning that has been the bread and butter of deep learning so far—rather, they’re\\napplicable to any form of machine learni ng, including unsupervised, self-supervised,\\nand reinforcement learning. It isn’t fundam entally important where your labels come\\nfrom or what your training loop looks like ; these different branch es of machine learn-\\ning are different facets of the same construct. Let’s dive in.\\n9.3.1 Models as programs\\nAs noted in the previous section, a nece ssary transformational development that we\\ncan expect in the field of machine learning is a move away from models that perform\\npurely pattern recognition  and can only achieve local generalization , toward models capa-\\nble of abstraction  and reasoning  that can achieve extreme generalization . Current AI pro-\\ngrams that are capable of basic forms of  reasoning are all hardcoded by human\\nprogrammers: for instan ce, software that relies on search algorithms, graph manipula-\\ntion, and formal logic. In D eepMind’s AlphaGo, for example, most of the intelligence\\non display is designed and hardcoded by expert programmers (such as Monte Carlo\\nTree Search); learning from data happens only in specialized submodules (value net-\\nworks and policy networks). But in the futu re, such AI systems may be fully learned,\\nwith no human involvement.\\n What path could make this happen? Consider a well-known type of network: RNN s.\\nIt’s important to note that RNN s have slightly fewer limitations than feedforward net-\\nworks. That’s because RNN s are a bit more than mere  geometric transformations:\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 352}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='331 The future of deep learning\\nthey’re geometric transformations repeatedly applied inside a for loop. The temporal for\\nloop is itself hardcoded by  human developers: it’s a bu ilt-in assumption of the net-\\nwork. Naturally, RNN s are still extremely limited in what they can represent, primarily\\nbecause each step they perform is a differ entiable geometric transformation, and they\\ncarry information from step to step via points in a continuous geometric space (state\\nvectors). Now imagine a neural  network that’s augmented in a similar way with pro-\\ngramming primitives—but inst ead of a single hardcoded for l o o p  w i t h  h a r d c o d e d\\ngeometric memory, the network includes a large set of  programming primitives that\\nthe model is free to manipulate to ex pand its processing function, such as if\\nbranches, while  statements, variable creation, di sk storage for long-term memory,\\nsorting operators, advanced data structures (such as lis ts, graphs, and hash tables),\\nand many more. The space of programs that  such a network could represent would be\\nfar broader than what can be represented with current deep-learning models, andsome of these programs could achieve superior generalization power.\\n We’ll move away from having, on one hand, hardcoded algorithmic intelligence\\n(handcrafted software) and, on the other hand, learned geometric intelligence (deep\\nlearning). Instead, we’ll have a blend of formal algorithmic modu les that provide rea-\\nsoning and abstraction capabilities, and geometric modules that provide informal\\nintuition and pattern-recognition capabiliti es. The entire system will be learned with\\nlittle or no human involvement.\\n A related subfield of \\nAI that I think may be about to take off in a big way is program\\nsynthesis , in particular neural program synthesi s. Program synthesis consists of auto-\\nmatically generating simple programs by us ing a search algorithm (possibly genetic\\nsearch, as in genetic programming) to ex plore a large space of possible programs.\\nThe search stops when a program is found that matches the required specifications,\\noften provided as a set of input-output pair s. This is highly reminiscent of machine\\nlearning: given training data provided as input-output pairs, we find a program that\\nmatches inputs to outputs and can generalize to new inputs. The difference is thatinstead of learning parameter values in a hardcoded program (a neural network), we\\ngenerate source code via a discrete search process.\\n I definitely expect this subfield to see a wave of renewed interest in the next few\\nyears. In particular, I expect the emerge nce of a crossover su bfield between deep\\nlearning and program synthesis, where inst ead of generating programs in a general-\\npurpose language, we’ll generate neural ne tworks (geometric data-processing flows)\\naugmented with a rich set of al gorithmic primitives, such as \\nfor loops and many oth-\\ners (see figure 9.5). This sh ould be far more tractable an d useful than directly gener-\\nating source code, and it wi ll dramatically expand the sc ope of problems that can be\\nsolved with machine learning—the space of programs that we can generate automati-\\ncally, given appropriate training data. Contemporary RNN s can be seen as a prehis-\\ntoric ancestor of such hybrid algorithmic-geometric models.\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 353}),\n",

As a result,using backpropagation to adjust weight valu es in a fixed, hardcoded network can’t be\\nthe method of choice for training models in  the future—at least, it can’t be the entire\\nstory. We need to figure out how to trai n non-differentiable syst ems efficiently. Cur-\\nrent approaches include genetic algorithms,  evolution strategies, certain reinforce-\\nment-learning methods, and alternatin g direction method of multipliers (\\nADMM ).\\nNaturally, gradient descent isn’t going an ywhere; gradient information will always be\\nuseful for optimizing differentiable parametric functions. But our models will become\\nincreasingly more ambitious than mere diff erentiable parametric functions, and thus\\ntheir automatic development (the learning  in machine learning ) will require more than\\nbackpropagation.\\n In addition, backpropagation is end to end, which is a great thing for learning\\ngood chained transformations but is comput ationally inefficient because it doesn’t\\nfully take advantage of the modularity of  deep networks. To make something more\\nefficient, there’s one universa l recipe: introduce modularity and hierarchy. So we can\\nmake backpropagation more efficient by introducing decoupled training modules\\nwith a synchronization mechanism between th em, organized in a hierarchical fashion.\\nThis strategy is somewhat re flected in DeepMind’s recent work on synthetic gradients.\\nI expect more along these lines in the near  future. I can imagine a future where mod-\\nels that are globally non-differentiable (but  feature differentiable parts) are trained—\\ngrown—using an efficient search process th at doesn’t use gradients, whereas the dif-\\nferentiable parts are trained even faster by  taking advantage of gradients using a more\\nefficient version of backpropagation. \\n9.3.3 Automated machine learning\\nIn the future, model architectures will be le arned rather than be handcrafted by engi-\\nneer-artisans.

              " Document(page_content='333 The future of deep learning\\n Currently, most of the job of a deep-l earning engineer consists of munging data\\nwith Python scripts and then tuning the architecture and hype rparameters of a deep\\nnetwork at length to get a working model—or even to get a state-of-the-art model, if\\nthe engineer is that ambitious.  Needless to say, that isn’t an optimal setup. But AI can\\nhelp. Unfortunately, the data-munging part  is tough to automate, because it often\\nrequires domain knowledge as well as a cl ear, high-level understanding of what the\\nengineer wants to achieve. Hyperparameter tuning, however, is a simple search proce-\\ndure; and in that case we know what the engineer wants to achieve: it’s defined by the\\nloss function of the network being tuned. It ’s already common practi ce to set up basic\\nAutoML  systems that take care of most model knob tuning. I even set up my own, years\\nago, to win Kaggle competitions.\\n At the most basic level, such a system wo uld tune the number of layers in a stack,\\ntheir order, and the number of units or fi lters in each layer. This is commonly done\\nwith libraries such as  Hyperopt, which we discussed in  chapter 7. But we can also be\\nfar more ambitious and attempt to learn an  appropriate architecture from scratch,\\nwith as few constraints as possible: for inst ance, via reinforcement learning or genetic\\nalgorithms.\\n Another important AutoML direction involv es learning model architecture jointly\\nwith model weights. Because training a ne w model from scratch every time we try a\\nslightly different architecture is tremendo usly inefficient, a truly powerful AutoML\\nsystem would evolve architectures at the same time the featur es of the model were\\nbeing tuned via backpropagation on the tr aining data. Such approaches are begin-\\nning to emerge as I write these lines.\\n When this starts to happen, the jobs of machine-learning engineers won’t disap-\\npear—rather, engineers will move up the valu e-creation chain. They will begin to put\\nmuch more effort into crafting complex lo ss functions that truly reflect business goals\\nand understanding how their models impact the digital ecosystems in which they’re\\ndeployed (for example, the users who co nsume the model’s predictions and generate\\nthe model’s training data)— problems that only the larg est companies can afford to\\nconsider at present. \\n9.3.4 Lifelong learning and modular subroutine reuse\\nIf models become more complex and are built  on top of richer algorithmic primitives,\\nthen this increased complexity will requir e higher reuse between tasks, rather than\\ntraining a new model from scratch every ti me we have a new task or a new dataset.\\nMany datasets don’t contain enough inform ation for us to develop a new, complex\\nmodel from scratch, and it will be necessary to use information from previously\\nencountered datasets (much as you don’t learn English from scratch every time youopen a new book—that would be impossible). Training models from scratch on every\\nnew task is also inefficient due to the la rge overlap between the current tasks and pre-\\nviously encoun tered tasks.\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 355}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='334 CHAPTER  9Conclusions\\n A remarkable observation has been made re peatedly in recent years: training the\\nsame model to do several loosely connected ta sks at the same time  results in a model\\nthat’s better at each task . For instance, training the sa me neural machine-translation\\nmodel to perform both English-to-German translation and French-to-Italian transla-\\ntion will result in a model that’s better at  each language pair. Similarly, training an\\nimage-classification model jo intly with an image-segmen tation model, sharing the\\nsame convolutional base, results in a model th at’s better at both tasks. This is fairly\\nintuitive: there’s always some information overlap between seemingly disconnected\\ntasks, and a joint model has access to a greater amount of in formation about each\\nindividual task than a model traine d on that specific task only.\\n Currently, when it comes to model reuse across tasks, we use pr etrained weights for\\nmodels that perform common fu nctions, such as visual feature extraction. You saw\\nthis in action in chapter 5. In the future, I expect a generalized version of this to be\\ncommonplace: we’ll use not only previously learned features (sub model weights) but\\nalso model architectures and training procedures. As mo dels become more like pro-\\ngrams, we’ll begin to reuse program subroutines  like the functions and classes found in\\nhuman programming languages.\\n Think of the process of soft ware development today: once an engineer solves a spe-\\ncific problem ( HTTP  queries in Python, for instance), they package it as an abstract,\\nreusable library. Engineers wh o face a similar problem in the future will be able to\\nsearch for existing libraries, download one, and use it in their own project. In a similar\\nway, in the future, metalearni ng systems will be able to assemble new programs by sift-\\ning through a global library of high-level re usable blocks. When the system finds itself\\ndeveloping similar program su broutines for several differe nt tasks, it can come up\\nwith an abstract, reusable version of the subroutine and store it in the global library\\n(see figure 9.6). Such a process will implement abstraction : a necessary component for\\nachieving extreme generalization. A subroutine  that’s useful across different tasks and\\ndomains can be said to abstract  some aspect of problem solving. This definition of\\nabstraction is similar to the notion of ab straction in software engineering. These sub-\\nroutines can be either geometric (deep-learning modules with pretrained representa-\\ntions) or algorithmic (closer to the libra ries that contemporary software engineers\\nmanipulate).\\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 356}),\n",

This is the perfect setup for deep-learning research if you don’t have a\\nGPU on your local machine. The original (and up-to-date) version of this guide can\\nbe found at https:/ /blog.keras.io .\\nB.1 What are Jupyter notebooks? \\nWhy run Jupyter notebooks on AWS GPUs?\\nA Jupyter notebook  is a web app that allows you to write and annotate Python code\\ninteractively. It’s a great way to experi ment, do research, and share what you’re\\nworking on.\\n Many deep-learning applications are ve ry computationally intensive and can take\\nhours or even days when running on a laptop’s CPU cores. Running on a GPU can\\nspeed up training and inference by a consid erable factor (often 5 to 10 times, when\\ngoing from a modern CPU to a single modern GPU). But you may not have access to\\na GPU on your local machine. Ru nning Jupyter notebooks on AWS gives you the same\\nexperience as running on your local machine, while allowing you to use one or sev-\\neral GPUs on AWS. And you only pay for what you use, which can compare favorably\\nto investing in your own GPU(s) if you use deep learning only occasionally. \\nLicensed to   <null>', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/deeplearningwithpython.pdf', 'page': 367}),\n",

The one we suggest using costs\\n$0.90 per hour. This is fine for occasional use; but if you’re go ing to run experiments\\nfor several hours per day every day, then you’re better off building your own deep-\\nlearning machine with a TITAN X  or GTX 1080 Ti.\\n In summary, use the Jupyter-on-EC2 setu p if you don’t have access to a local GPU or\\ni f  y o u  d o n ’ t  w a n t  t o  d e a l  w i t h  i n s t a lling Keras dependencies, in particular GPU\\ndrivers.

Some familiarity with AWS EC2 will\\nhelp, but it isn’t mandatory. \\nB.3 Setting up an AWS GPU instance\\nThe following setup process wi ll take 5 to 10 minutes:\\n1Navigate to the EC2 control panel at https:/ /console.aws. amazon.com/ec2/v2 ,\\nand click the Launch Instance link (see figure B.1).\\n2Select AWS Marketplace (see figure B.2), and search for “deep learning” in the\\nsearch box.

We went from near-unusable speech and image recognition, to near-human accuracy. We went from \\nmachines that couldn’t beat a serious Go player, to defeating a world champion. Behind this progress is deep learning—a combination of engineering advances, best practices, and theory that enables a wealth of previously impossible smart applications.\\nDeep Learning with Python  introduces the ﬁ  eld of deep learn-\\ning using the Python language and the powerful Keras library. Written by Keras creator and \\nGoogle AI researcher François \\nChollet, this book builds your understanding through intuitive explanations and practical examples. You’ll explore challenging concepts and practice with applications in computer vision, natural-language processing, and generative models. By the time you ﬁ  nish, you’ll have the knowledge and hands-on skills \\nto apply deep learning in your own projects. \\nWhat’s Inside\\n● Deep learning from ﬁ  rst principles\\n● Setting up your own deep-learning environment\\n● Image-classiﬁ  cation models\\n● Deep learning for text and sequences\\n● Neural style transfer, text generation, and image generation\\nReaders need intermediate Python skills.
